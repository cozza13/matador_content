As it turns out, you don't actually need a scuba suit to visit many shipwrecks around the world.

When I think of shipwrecks, my thoughts immediately drift toward images of treasure chests, jugs of rum, and the Kraken. I don't tend to think of shipwreck sites as being particularly convenient places to visit: there are diving lessons, boat charters, and submarines that all need to be sorted out first. And I don't even own a set of swim fins.

Then, I stumbled across a photo of the Peter Iredale. Over 100 years old, full of maritime history, and easily accessible on the beach in Fort Stevens State Park, Oregon, this wreck showed me that you can visit some famous wrecks without even getting your toes wet.

Take a look at these shipwrecks that have become a part of their surrounding landscapes.
