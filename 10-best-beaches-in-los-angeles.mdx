Los Angeles without beaches is like tacos without tortillas…it just doesn’t add up. The sand and surf that’s to be found up and down LA’s coastline are a defining feature of the city. I make it a point to avail myself of the dozens of public beaches and piers whenever I can, exploring the shoreline from Malibu to Redondo. These are my go-to spots to catch some sun and jump in the Pacific.

Huntington Dog Beach

 Huntington Dog BeachMarina del Rey, United StatesHuntington Beach - Dog Beach! Located North of Goldenwest and Lifeguard Tower 22 is the best place to take your dog to the beach in Southern California. Dogs are not allowed on the beach in LA County. HBDogbeach is an off-leash party for all dogs!


Malibu Pier

 Malibu PierMalibu, United StatesIf you are driving through Malibu on the Pacific Coast Highway, pull off the road and check out the Malibu Pier. It's a nice little stroll to the end of the big 'ol dock where there is a very good cafe and several hungry seagulls. There are almost always surfers and SUP riders catching waves next to the pier, check them out. #beach #malibu #free


Will Rogers Beach State Park

 Will Rogers Beach State ParkLos Angeles, United StatesJust north of Santa Monica is Will Rogers. If the tourist vibe and the crowds of the SM Pier and the beach are too much (or the parking too scant) just drive a bit further north and settle on the more chill but no less beachy Will Rogers. There are volleyball nets and pedestrian tunnels that access the other side of thr PCH. Nearby Patrick's is an Irish themed restuarant with good grub. #beach


Topanga Beach

 Topanga BeachMalibu, United StatesTopanga beach is easily access via an under-the-bridge graffitti plastered pedestrian walk that is just too cool not to stop and take a photo of. The beach itself is good, not great with sections of rocky beach and surf. But it's pretty chill and if a nice place to dip your toes in the water. #beach #losangeles


Santa Monica State Beach

 Santa Monica State BeachSanta Monica, United StatesThis is LA's sandy main squeeze - Santa Monica SB is a long stretch of golden sand and steady surf. On the weekends thousands of Angelinos and visitors flock to the SM beach. Rent a bike and cruise to Venice Beach and / or cool off by jumping in the Pacific. #beach #santamonica #park #surfing


Point Dume State Beach

 Point Dume State BeachMalibu, United StatesEpic lookout on the Point Dume park hike. Start on the big hill where google maps says "Point Dume Park" should be, then hike the sandy trail around to the beach. Top 5 spots in Malibu!


Venice Fishing Pier

 Venice Fishing PierMarina del Rey, United StatesA wonderful place to be at sunset, the Venice fishing pier is neither beautiful nor ornate. It's functional and juts out like a concrete tongue into the Pacific so that fisherpeople may try their hand at realing in dinner. #venicebeach


Ballona Creek Bridge

 Ballona Creek BridgeLos Angeles, United StatesThe Ballona Creek Bridge is pedestrian-only thoroughfare that connects Playa del Rey to Marina del Ray via bike path. It's also an awesome place to watch boats sail into Marina del Rey. Nearby is the Ballona Creek Wetlands which also has walking and bike trails. The Bridge is a nice stopping pount between two destinations on the 22 mile Marvin Braude bike trail. #beach #bikepath #marinadelrey


Manhattan Beach Pier

 Manhattan Beach PierManhattan Beach, United StatesAnother of LA's beautiful beach front piers, the Manhattan Beach Pier is perhaps one of the most handsome. There is a small aquarium at the end of the pier and you can often see surfers catching waves next to the pilings that rise out of the waves and support the structure. #manhattanbeach #beach


Burnout Beach

 Burnout BeachRedondo Beach, United StatesI grabbed beer at King Harbor Brewery and ended up on this stretch empty beach as the sun set. Score. Burnout is near the edge of Rachos Palos Verdes where the land rises sharply and the yellow sand stops its long unbroken march. #beach #redondo
