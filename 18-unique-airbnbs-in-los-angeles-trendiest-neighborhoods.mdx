Los Angeles is not a cheap place to live. The average home sells for more than $700,000, but you can experience the Hollywood or Malibu life vicariously for far cheaper through the vast number of Airbnb rentals available at your fingertips, even in the city’s trendiest neighborhoods. Pretend that you’re a celebrity for a day -- you can literally rent Charlie Chaplin or Harry Houdini’s old haunts. No US city offers better cultural attractions, street tacos, celebrity sightings, and beach access all in the same day than Los Angeles. Here’s where to stay while you’re here.

Charming Three-Bedroom Venice Beach Bungalow
[gallery ids="700197,700196,700198" size="full" type="slider" /]

Houses pass for bungalows in Venice, where even the trendiest, most modern of hipsters don paintbrushes and skateboards when venturing to the beach and an otherwise normal lawn is considered eco-friendly. Here, you’re walking distance to Abbot Kinney and Marina del Ray, as well as Venice’s famed nightlife and beach scenes. Should you desire some privacy, the bungalow provides plenty of it -- without sacrificing the beach vibes, of course, or the Southern Califonia sun. The open floor plan extends straight to the palm-lined outdoors. For a night out, check out the many nearby Black-owned restaurants in Los Angeles.

Staying in a city center should offer pristine views of, well, said city enter. That's exactly what you'll get here at this luxurious flat with views high above downtown Los Angeles.

Walk everywhere from the Staples Center to world-class dining, and hop a train out towards the beach for a day. This apartment has a nice pool, a gym, and cocktails available in the building, along with a comfortable in-room experience with high thread count sheets and expansive views.
