As soon as the hike begins there is a path to the Sutro baths, which are now an impressive ruin. The structure was designed by Adolph Sutro in the late 19th century as a recreational area and bathhouse for the working class folks. About half mile on the right another path leads to the Palace of the Legion of Honor art museum.

Take a right turn on Mesa Road and you'll come across the trailhead after 5.8 miles. Being part of the 15-mile Coast Trail, a two-day backpacking hike, this trail is often busy, especially in springtime.

The trail turns inland and heads towards the lakes, Bass Lake, Crystal Lake and Pelican Lake. All three lakes are accessible by visible small detours from the main trail. After the last lake, an unmarked left turnoff (many hikers miss it) leads to the waterfalls. The main trail keeps straight toward the Wildcat Camp, which is the perfect spot to pitch a tent for the night. Once out of the narrow and overgrown with poison oak trail the scenery starts to unfold, from here a steep route goes all the way down to the beach for a stunning view of the waterfalls cascading into the sand.
