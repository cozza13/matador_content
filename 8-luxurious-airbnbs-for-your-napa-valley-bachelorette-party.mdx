Location is key when considering Airbnbs for a bachelorette party in Napa because the Valley is more than a one-stop-shop. Stretching 30 miles from tip to tail and flanked by its lesser-known but equally charming sister Sonoma Valley, Northern California’s wine country offers an unforgettable backdrop to a girlfriend's wine and dine getaway. While most Airbnb listings have acres of beautiful vineyards and complimentary wine on arrival, take care to select one that meets your party's bachelorette vision. Here we've simplified the search by compiling a list of luxury Airbnbs in Napa Valley towns that will take your party to the next level.
