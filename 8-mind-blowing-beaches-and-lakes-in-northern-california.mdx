California has 840 miles of ocean coastline, much of it almost deserted. Here are a few lesser-known Northern California gems to set you off in the right direction.

San Francisco Area
San Francisco doesn’t spring to mind as a beach town, but it is surrounded on three sides by water. While none of SF’s beaches are crowded, these small beaches offer unique vistas:
China Beach

Marshalls Beach

 Marshall's BeachSan Francisco, United StatesGreat view of the Golden Gate Bridge from both higher and lower elevations, depending on how far you want to walk. #sunset #bridge #view #goldengate


North of San Francisco
Tennessee Valley, just north of San Francisco, isn’t a secret -- you’ll find others on the trail -- but it still feels special to arrive at this perfect little beach after a 3 mile hike. Great views back to SF and south.

For a more rigorous trail you can venture off one of the other trails that lead up in the hills. #hiking #beach #marin #california



Tomales Bay has a few great beaches and the water is warmer and much safer than the ocean if you’re visiting with kids. Check out Millerton and Heart’s Desire.

Further north, the Sonoma Coast State Beaches are windswept and wild. Salmon Creek at the southern end is great for kids as they can swim in the much-warmer creek, while Goat Rock Beach at the northern end is especially dramatic with the Russian River pouring into the Pacific. Several great hikes lead to or from Shell Beach.

Continuing north, the Lost Coast is a backpacking trip full of beaches in a location too rugged for roadbuilding.

South of San Francisco
Heading south from San Francisco, Bean Hollow is a tiny beach on the San Mateo Coast with white sand and plenty of sea life.

Limekiln State Beach, south of Big Sur, is less crowded than other beaches in that area and offers a great waterfall hike, and clean campground, in addition to a black sand beach.

Sierra Beaches
California’s beaches are not limited to the Ocean - head up to the Sierras for many lakes, many of which are very lightly visited. While the water is often cold, few things compare with the feeling of drying off in the summer sun after a swim in a high-altitude lake. Here are a few to get you planning for next summer.
Lakes Lodge

 Ice Lakes LodgeSoda Springs, United StatesThe Sierra's best kept secret. Serene Lakes, named by Mark Twain. Mountain paradaise.


Grant Lake Marina

 Grant Lake MarinaJune Lake, United StatesOne of my favorite spots for summertime lounging in the area. Excellent (but cold) wake boarding, plenty of beach space, and the kind of view you'd expect from the June Lake Loop. Plush campsites with hookups and actual toilets that flush nearby. Fancy!


Upper Blue Lake Campground

Ashley Lake

 Ashley LakeMadera County, United StatesAbsolutely gorgeous place to camp in the Southern Sierra backcountry.
