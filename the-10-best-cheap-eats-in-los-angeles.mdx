If you’re like me you are always on the hunt for a tasty meal that’s heavy on flavor and authenticity but light on the wallet. My go-to spots for food tend to be spots that manage to straddle that magic line of being awesome and affordable. This means some of these spots, Like Gjelina Takeaway and Homestate, regularly have a line snaking out the door and a shortage of available seats. If there is a wait, it’s usually worth it!

Messhall Kitchen

 Messhall KitchenLos Angeles, United StatesMesshall is a great spot anytime of the day but they are especially known for their brunch, served daily. The $1 fresh shucked oysters and $1 tacos on Tuesday can't be beat - I rarely miss a Tuesday oyster binge at Messhall! #happyhour #food


Palermo Ristorante Italiano

 Palermo Ristorante ItalianoLos Angeles, United StatesThis is the best Italian in Hollywood as far as my mouth is concerned!

Highly recommended!! #italian #pizza


Spitz - Los Feliz

 Spitz - Los FelizLos Angeles, United StatesSpitz does doner wraps and crazy good 'street cart fries' ( smothered in aoli, feta, onions, peppercinis, tomatos ) and of course beer and sangria. The 'Not Unhappy Hour' has good food and drink specials and there is tliveky trivia night on Tuesday nights. #cheap-eats #food #losangeles

The Dudley Market

 The Dudley MarketLos Angeles, United StatesThe Dudley is fine cuisine in a relaxed but sophisticated atmosphere. Giant windows let light into the relatively small space giving it a sense of expansiveness. A small retail 'market' allows you to walk away with some ingrediants for your home spun culinary adventures. #fine-dinning #venicebeach

Nelson's

 Nelson'sRancho Palos Verdes, United StatesNelson's sits on the edge of 100+ foot sea facing cliffs that drop down to the edge of the Pacific Ocean. The view is nothing short of amazing. The food is good too...as well it should be for a $20 burger. Keep your eyes of the ocean to spot whales, dolphin, pelicans and sea lions. #oceanview #restaurant
