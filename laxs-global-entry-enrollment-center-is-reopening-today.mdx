Eagerness to speed through airport security lines and customs might be at an all-time high right now, as demand for travel is picking up, but flyers also want to remain safe.

For the conditionally approved Global Entry applicants eagerly awaiting their interview to complete their enrollment into the program, there’s some good news. After all Trusted Traveler Program Enrollment Centers closed in March because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US Custom and Border Protection agency has announced that one is reopening on July 6 -- the Global Entry Enrollment Center (GEEC) at LAX.

Global Entry members are granted expedited security clearance upon entering the United States from abroad. Once in the program, instead of joining the main customs declaration line, travelers head to a designated kiosk to make any declarations and pass through passport control upon arriving from an international flight. Global Entry also includes TSA PreCheck, a program that allows you to join a typically shorter line during the pre-boarding security process.

When LAX’S GEEC reopens, social distancing protocols will be in place, such as staggered appointments, reduced waiting area seating, plastic barriers at service counters, and a face mask requirement for employees and visitors.

On March 19, all enrollment centers were shut down, and in-person interviews for Global Entry, SENTRI, NEXUS, and FAST were suspended. If you’re a Global Entry member, or the member of another Trusted Traveler Program, an 18-month grace period has been put in place, so you can keep using your membership even after it expires, but you need to apply for renewal before the expiration date.

Luckily for TSA PreCheck hopefuls, those in-person interviews have been operating without interruption across the country. [mn-post-ender]
