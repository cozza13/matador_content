AS A WRITER I pretty much exist between two worlds at once: the “real” world, and my imagination. But I still need somewhere to work. These 10 cafes in LA range from the high-end to the homely to the chic. They all offer great drip coffee and espresso, and you won’t get any dirty looks when you bring out your laptop.
1. Bourgeois Pig
I love to go here if I land in the city after 10pm, or if it’s the middle of the week and I’m not in the mood to swig beer and take shots. The Bourgeois Pig is open till the wee hours -- which isn’t that common in LA -- and although it’s in a popular location, it never gets too noisy. There’s a pool table in the back room which is decked out like an enchanted forest and is watched over by a stuffed owl. The kitchen is open late too, and the Rotisserie Chicken Panini makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

2. The Cow’s End Café
Normally I go to cafes to work whilst drinking a latte, and I’ll eat elsewhere. But I love the sandwiches at The Cow’s End and would rather eat a sandwich there than at a restaurant or deli. There’s a study lounge upstairs that’s nice and cozy to work in.

3. Intelligentsia Coffee &amp; Tea
As a coffee enthusiast and frustrated barista, I always stop by Intelligentsia. It’s in every hipster travel guide, including my own, but there’s a good reason it sets the bar for other indie coffee shops: they offer freshly roasted coffee, perfectly noted cappuccinos, and a knowledgeable staff. I prefer the Sunset Boulevard location as it’s smaller and most of the customers do carry-out, leaving the tables for me and my mobile office.

4. Demitasse
The first time I saw Demitasse I was a bit blue about having to postpone a trip to Europe, but after walking in here that all went away. Their espresso machine is a thing of beauty. They offer all the usual café fare and they do it well, with smooth espressos and yummy sandwiches. But they also have items that you can take home and brag about. “Oh you’ve never had an oatmeal latte? Well, when I was in LA...”

5. Stir Crazy Coffee Shop
Stir Crazy is one of my favorite places to hunker down if I have a deadline. They offer bottomless cups of coffee, comfortable seating, and great service, meaning you just have to worry about the words.

6. Coffee Commissary
In my opinion, Coffee Commissary has hands-down the best drip coffee in LA, and is perfect for iced coffees. It’s an industrial-style space with friendly staff, and they have the most deliciously chunky chocolate chips in their cookies. If I’m not pushed for time I order two and enjoy the people-watching.

7. Susina Bakery &amp; Café
Susina’s has amazing combinations of cakes and teas. Pretty much everything on the menu is divine, but I think the berry blossom cake and coconut crème tea (served in a mini French press) is definitely the way to go. This is a very popular spot, but isn’t ridiculously crowded if you go early or late. They have paid WiFi, but the ambience is more conducive to note-taking and composing love letters to the boy you met at the bar last night.
