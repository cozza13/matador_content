Okay, let’s get this over with. You may not want to admit it, and I may not want to admit it, but Barbie’s Dreamhouse is pretty sweet. It’s probably not where I’d hold my bachelor party, but a mansion is a mansion, and this theme (“dream?”) house is nothing to sneeze at -- especially if you grew up with Barbies as a kid. Modeled after the plastic playset of your childhood, the Dreamhouse is now on Airbnb and costs just $60 per night.

Located in Malibu, California, the Dreamhouse has three floors with views of the ocean, several open spaces for chilling out, a hot pink waterslide, an infinity pool, personal cinema, and a closet filled with Barbie attire. The house also comes with an array of cool experiences, like lessons with fencing champion Ibtihaj Muhammad, a meal prepared by Malibu chef Gina Clarke-Helm, a Columbia Memorial Space Center tour by aerospace engineer Jill Meyers, and makeovers by celebrity hair stylist Jen Atkin.

If it sounds too good to be true, it’s because the Dreamhouse is only available for one weekend -- October 27 through October 29. Booking opens at 11:00 AM PT on October 23, so you’d better be quick on the trigger. [mn-post-ender]
