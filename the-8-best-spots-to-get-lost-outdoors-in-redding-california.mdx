REDDING is enclosed on all sides by craggy hills, mountain peaks, and volcanoes. The city itself has many opportunities to eat and drink and experience, but escaping into the great outdoors is the best way to really immerse yourself here. Waterfalls, trails, crests, cliffs, meadows, and peaks are all within easy reach.
