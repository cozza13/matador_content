Northern California is really something else. I grew up hiking in Marin County and roasting marshmallows at Lake Tahoe. As a photographer, I am naturally drawn to the area again and again to find new images to capture as the area seems to have an endless well of beauty to draw from. The best part about the area, though, is that you don’t have to make many arrangements in advance to soak up the scenery -- all you need to do is get in the car and drive, making Northern California the perfect road trip for last minute travelers before the end of summer. Now that Highway 1 has finally reopened, it’s time to hit the road. From Mount Tamalpais and the Point Reyes Seashore in Marin County all the way to Emerald Bay in Lake Tahoe, here are the most spectacular sights I’ve seen along this route, which are sure to inspire a spontaneous adventure.
