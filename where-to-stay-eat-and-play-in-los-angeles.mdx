How do I get to Los Angeles?

Los Angeles International Airport, or LAX, is the primary gateway to the city. Although the airport's infrastructure is dated and the traffic around the airport can be off-putting, it's generally your best bet for affordable flights and proximity to LA's west side and neighborhoods to the south. For areas to the east and the San Fernando Valley, the Hollywood Burbank Airport is more convenient. In addition, the airfield's two compact terminals make flying in and out super easy.
How do I get around Los Angeles?

All of the rumors about LA traffic being a beast are true. Nevertheless, a car is essential as the top sites are scattered across the city. You'll want to rent a car for ultimate convenience, but rideshare companies like Uber or Lyft work as an alternative. LA's public transportation is improving, but its efficiency depends on your location. For example, the Metro's Expo Line is only convenient for stops between Downtown LA and Santa Monica, a mere 15-mile trip. The city has some relatively pedestrian and bike-friendly neighborhoods, including the beach communities between Santa Monica and Playa del Rey. So, if you're staying local, check apps like Lime and Bird for e-Bike and scooter sharing.
The best things to do in Los Angeles
Visit the Downtown Arts District

From its roots as an underground artist refuge in the 1970s to the thriving creative neighborhood it is today, the Downtown Arts District is an unmissable destination in Los Angeles. Head to Art Share LA, a live/work and gallery space for emerging artists in a converted warehouse with an ever-changing slate of exhibits and performances. Thanks to a partnership with nearby Angel City Brewery, you can pair craft beer with Art Share LA's themed exhibitions at the brewery's Public House.

Sun yourself at Playa Del Rey Beach
Just north of LAX, the small beach community of Playa Del Rey has a gorgeous wide sandy beach easily accessed from the 22-mile Marvin Braude Bike Trail. This stretch of shoreline is virtually crowd-free due to limited public parking lots. Instead, opt for free street parking in the surrounding residential neighborhood, then stop at nearby Playa Provisions for a picnic lunch on your way down to the sand.
Watch a movie at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery

The final resting place of Hollywood icons Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney may seem like an odd choice for a fun night out. Still, the Hollywood Forever cemetery attracts crowds each week between May and October for screenings of classic films projected onto a mausoleum once the sun goes down. Moviegoers bring blankets, chairs, and picnic spreads to the expansive Fairbanks Lawn for an unforgettable entertainment experience. Hollywood Forever also hosts the country's largest Dia de Los Muertos – Day of the Dead festival each November, complete with a ritual procession, music, art, and food.

The stage at the Hollywood Bowl, the famed outdoor music venue tucked into a canyon in its namesake neighborhood, has been graced by everyone from the Beatles to JayZ throughout its 100-year history. But it doesn't matter who is performing because attending any show at the Hollywood Bowl is an experience. You can pack your own food or pre-order a gourmet meal from award-winning chef Suzanne Goin's menu to enjoy in your box seats. If a picnic is more your style, the on-site marketplaces have plenty of take-out options for every taste, along with premium beer and wine.

Where: 2301 N Highland Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90068
Dive into LA’s Shopping scene
Beyond the famed Rodeo Drive, the city's neighborhoods are peppered with impressive shopping streets.

Head to Abbot Kinney Boulevard, steps from Venice Beach, for a mile-long stretch of on-trend boutiques, cafes, and outstanding street art. Stop into Principessa for chic, bohemian women's wear.

A 30 minute drive east of Venice, in LA’s Fairfax neighborhood, you’ll find La Brea Avenue, the place to go for vintage finds. Start at Jet Rag, a Los Angeles institution known for its $1 Sunday sales. Then head to Recess to source consigned vintage and contemporary Haute Couture treasures from designers like Givenchy and Christian Dior.

Larchmont Village, two miles southeast of Fairfax, has a small-town feel in a big city. The area's main street, Larchmont Boulevard, is home to Chevalier’s Books, LA's oldest independent bookstore. Finally, don't miss nearby Res Ipsa for handmade Moroccan kilim shoes before grabbing a locally roasted coffee at Groundwork.

Gjelina

As soon as Gjelina opened its doors on Venice's Abbot Kinney Boulevard in 2008, it attracted a fan base, and not much has changed since then. The stark concrete walls and brick floor contrast sharply with the large communal table and airy bar. Try the pizza with guanciale, Castelvetrano olives, and Fresno chilis or the tender beef tartare on sourdough. You cannot leave without tasting the butterscotch pot de crème topped with salted caramel and crème fraîche.

Where: 1429 Abbot Kinney Blvd, Venice, CA 90291
Chiba Sushi
Angelinos love their sushi and will fiercely defend their favorite places. Still, Chiba, a family-run restaurant in an unassuming single-story building in North Hollywood, is the one to beat. Go for the Omakase or chefs' choice. They won't steer you wrong. For those with a more conservative sushi palate, the crunchy spicy tuna hand roll is perfect.

Where: 7515 Lankershim Blvd, North Hollywood, CA 91605
Jitlada

Where: 8136 W 3rd St, Los Angeles, CA 90048
