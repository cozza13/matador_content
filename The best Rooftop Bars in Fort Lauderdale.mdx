But you don’t always need a pool to get the good times rolling. The three additional rooftop bars featured here cater to those looking for excellent food and beverage with the added benefit of a killer view. From the rooftop pool bars that will keep you cool all day long to lively locales where the party goes until late, these are the six best rooftop bars in Fort Lauderdale right now.

Located on the eighth floor of Hyatt Centric Las Olas Fort Lauderdale, ELEV8 Pool Bar is an arty oasis surrounded by some of the city’s tallest skyscrapers. The sparkling pool is a welcome respite from the South Florida sun, while fire pits warm up chillier evenings.

“This art-infused escape allows our guests to soak in city views with one-of-a-kind murals as a backdrop,” says Joshua Morris ELEV8’s general manager. “As we roll out the new ELEV8 menu, we are elevating the typical rooftop pool and bar experience, making sure to leave our guests sunkissed and satisfied.”

Refreshing libations like frozen cherry limeade and a watermelon margarita are perfect for poolside sipping, while bar snacks, sandwiches, and salads can satisfy appetites big and small.

The Easton has a little something for everyone, whether you’re looking for a chill after-work cocktail, raucous weekend pool party, or Sunday morning yoga class. The indoor-outdoor venue features weekly DJs, sweeping views of surrounding Fort Lauderdale, and, of course, a lovely blue pool to enjoy.

“I think our most distinctive feature is having an amazing pool in the middle of our venue,” says Diego Echeverry the assistant general manager. “It gives our guests the opportunity to enjoy delightful craft cocktails at a rooftop bar and allows them to do it wearing a bikini while enjoying our lasting summer weather.”

The Easton has both signature and classic cocktails (think negronis and passionfruit margaritas) on deck, as well as bottle service and a small food menu.

There are few better places to grab a Margarita in Fort Lauderdale than Bar Rita, which serves its excellent variations both by the glass and by the pitcher. The original lime margarita comes frozen or on the rocks, but we love their signature takes on the classics like The Matador (reposado tequila, blood orange, and tonic) and the Mango Mezcalita (mezcal, mango, blanco tequila, and agave). The bi-level restaurant and bar feature a breezy open-air rooftop where you can sip your margarita of choice and nosh on dishes like Baja grilled shrimp and brisket barbacoa enchiladas. "
