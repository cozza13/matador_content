Issa Rae and Airbnb are offering the stay that dreams are made of for the committed Insecure fan who loves Super Bowl Sunday. For just $56 a night, one lucky guest and a friend will get the chance to stay in an Issa Rae-hosted Airbnb from February 12 through 14. Guest will have the chance to enjoy the iconic landmarks popularized by the show, along with the Black culture, businesses, and communities that make South LA so special.

First, get checked in virtually by the one and only Issa Rae. Next, take in the property -- a stylish mid-century View Park pad decorated with artwork by local Black artists including Maya Iman, Vakseen, and Domonique Brown. The home also boasts panoramic views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Hills from the outdoor lounge and a pool dripping in Issa vibes with chaise lounges and canopies. Then, find the curated guidebook filled with Issa's favorite local spots, including the Black-owned bookstore Eso Won Books, My 2 Cents, Supervsn Studios, Gorilla Rx Wellness, Swift Cafe, ALL CHILL, and Southern Girl Desserts -- and if that isn't enough suggestions, try any of these Black-owned restaurants in LA. After a day spent soaking up all there is to offer, return to the house to "wine down." On Sunday, enjoy the Sienna Naturals hair care line for some self-care and get ready for your "Game Day" dinner for two, courtesy of Worldwide Tacos, featured in the iconic season three episode.

Airbnb has also put together a $500,000 donation with Nasdaq. The money will help local organizations with visions in line with Nasdaq's ambitions to advance inclusive growth and prosperity and to empower under-represented communities in their efforts to generate wealth like LeadersUp, Central Neighborhood Health Foundation, and Brotherhood Crusade. The company also plans a first-time LA expansion of The Airbnb Entrepreneurship Academy and is collaborating with the non-profit Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center to offer an educational module focused on entrepreneurship and "solopreneurship" to Airbnb Academy participants.
 
"Since my series debuted in 2016, it's been an honor to showcase the people, culture and businesses that make South LA such a vibrant part of the city," Rae said in a statement. "I became an Airbnb Host to create a stay where fans of the show can experience this for themselves. From dinner by Worldwide Tacos on game day to art from my favorite local artists on the walls -- this is LA, my way."
