I KNOW it’s hard to imagine, while some of you are freezing in sub-zero temps, that in just three short months we’ll all be dancing half naked under the desert sky in Indio, California.

Yep, it’s that time of year again, when your Facebook feeds are flooded with 'who needs tickets' and your phone battery is dead from massive group texting situations discussing travel itineraries and the ever-important housing options. So as if pool parties at the Viceroy, plenty of margaritas and mojitos, Ferris wheel rides, and rubbing shoulders with celebs wasn’t reason enough for you to hit Coachella this year, here are some more.
1. Outkast

Before the days of Kendrick Lamar, we had Outkast. Not only is Aquemini one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time, but Big Boi and Andre 3000 are the epitome of the Dirty South. After six years of waiting, this Outkast reunion is long overdue and Coachella is the perfect backdrop.
2. The Knife
I’ve been waiting for this since the first time I heard “Heartbeats” on Deep Cuts in 2003. If Karin Dreijer Andersson’s 2010 Coachella performance with Fever Ray is any indication, this is about to go down as a top 10 all time Coachella moment (think Tupac hologram status).
3. Disclosure
Been to any Major Lazer shows lately? Diplo (and a million other DJs) have been bumping this dance hit all year. “When a Fire Starts to Burn” is guaranteed to turn Coachella into a massive electro dance party ASAP.
4. Muse
It’s hard to imagine the days when I wasn’t a firm believer in the rock super group that is Muse. But when Muse headlined Coachella in 2010, the incredible light show, guitar riffs, and straight class instantly converted me.
5. AlunaGeorge
This UK darling pop duo's 2013 album Body Music has grabbed the attention of music blogs everywhere since it dropped in July. I will be front row and center, holding out for the live Disclosure/AlunaGeoge collab, “White Noise.”
6. Lorde
I think it’s pretty safe to say that Lorde effectively completed world domination with her single “Royals.” Let’s welcome this 16-year-old Kiwi with some proper California love.
7. Lana Del Rey
I’m going to give Lana Del Rey one “web redemption” after that unforgettable SNL performance years ago. My faith was a bit restored after her addition to The Great Gatsby soundtrack with “Young and Beautiful.” Let’s see if she can live up to the hype this time.
8. Motorhead
Just because all of the hipsters need a reason to wear those vintage Motorhead t-shirts we all know you paid at least $85 for at Wasteland.
9. And all the killer bands I suggest you slot in AT LEAST 15 minutes for
The 1975, Chance the Rapper, Blood Orange, Washed Out, Future Islands, Holy Ghost!, CHVRCHES, Chromeo, Little Dragon, and Queens of the Stone Age.
