
You've never seen Yosemite like this. From summer to fall to the snowy depths of winter to the spring revival, this video takes you on a year-round tour of one of America's most extraordinary places.

What's so extraordinary about Yosemite? Trees so big you can walk through their root systems (without getting dirty). Foraging bears hanging out in sequoias. Waterfalls that seem to plunge to forever. Whitewater rafting the wild and free Merced River... What isn't extraordinary about Yosemite?

Enjoy this unique view of Yosemite, but, remember, the best way to see it is to get out there and experience it for yourself. Choose your favorite season and go. [mn-post-ender]
