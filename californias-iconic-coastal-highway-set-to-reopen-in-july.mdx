Just in time for the summer, the Pacific Coast Highway in California is about to reopen. The scenic Highway 1 closed last year after heavy winter storms caused landslides and an estimated one million tonnes of rock and dirt scattered over 12 miles of the road. The highway is set to reopen at the end of July, two months earlier than anticipated, following a major clean-up, stabilizing efforts, and the construction of a safety wall built at the foot of the landslide.

Communities near Highway 1 are pleasantly surprised by the route’s early reopening. Richard Rosales, of the California Department of Transportation, said: “By opening the highway sooner than expected, it will boost the many central coast communities affected by this major landslide.” 


Part of the highway was reopened last November when the Pfeiffer Canyon bridge -- damaged in the landslide --  was restored. The restoration helped open up the area to visitors, as well as give access to the local community who previously had to hike a mile to get in and out of their homes. 

Highway 1, or the Pacific Coast Highway, is often considered one of the US’s most iconic roads. It’s also the most scenic way to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and with the highway’s restoration, travelers can look forward to planning an epic summer road trip. [mn-post-ender]
