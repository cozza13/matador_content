Each month, the Griffith Observatory, along with the L. A. Astronomical Society, the L.A. Sidewalk Astronomers, and the Planetary Society, turn dozens of high-powered telescopes to the skies for the observatory’s monthly public star parties. At 2pm (yep, in daylight) on these highly anticipated Saturdays, professional and amateur astronomers, stationed across the lawn and over the observatory’s terraces, begin captaining people to the outer reaches of the Milky Way with stops to see Saturn’s rings, Jupiter’s storm, the sun’s flares, and whatever celestial bodies prominently emerge.

The on-ground star of the party always is the Zeiss refracting telescope, which has served more than 7 million people since it was mounted in its rooftop dome in 1935, making it the most looked-through telescope in all the world.
