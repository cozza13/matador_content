Drive 45 minutes north of Santa Barbara, and you might think you went all the way to Copenhagen. In the early 1900s, a trio of Danish immigrants founded a town called Solvang in the Santa Ynez Valley, and the mini Denmark they envisioned still exists today. The main drag is dotted with windmills and half-timber buildings, past which a horse-drawn trolley called The Honen, or "The Hen" in Danish, regularly shuttles visitors. These same visitors can spend their days visiting the Hans Christian Andersen and Elverhoj Museums before sampling every smørrebrød sandwich and aebleskiver pancake in town. Solvang is also surrounded by vineyards — one thing Central California has on Northern Europe. Whether you love a quirky town or want a memorable base for your next wine-tasting trip, these are the Solvang Airbnbs you need to book.

1. Papillion Rouge Stone Cottage
[gallery ids="715559,715560,715561,715562,715563" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Solvang may be the “Danish Capital of America” but this real-life cottagecore Pinterest board feels more like it belongs in the South of France — complete with a private vineyard. The generous studio sits on 20 acres, so the only neighbors you’re likely to run into are the deer and wild turkeys that sometimes roam the property, but there’s an organic farm down the road where you can stock up on locally sourced produce. Beyond that, downtown Solvang is just 10 minutes away, and a 15-minute drive will land you in wine country.

Note: The cottage sleeps four, but there’s a $50 per night fee for every additional guest after two adults.

2. Hygge Tower Apartment
[gallery ids="715569,715570,715571,715572,715573" size="full" type="slider"  /]

This two-bedroom apartment in the heart of Solvang was designed to channel hygge, a Danish term describing the feeling of contentment you get from being cozy. The decor nods to Scandinavian design — including a five-panel photograph of Copenhagen’s waterfront to really sell the Euro vibes — but the coolest detail is that the three-story apartment is located inside a replica of the Rundetårn tower in the Danish capital. As you might expect, the panoramas from the rooftop patio are unparalleled, and the downtown location makes this one of the most central Solvang Airbnbs on this list.

3. Hidden Views House
[gallery ids="715574,715575,715576,715577,715578" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Set within the rolling hills of the Santa Ynez Valley, this two-bedroom home is surrounded by five different vineyards. Wine tasting is probably the number one reason to book this Solvang Airbnb, but non-drinkers have plenty to do, as well. There’s great hiking around Lake Cachuma, multiple golf courses and the Chumash casino nearby, and beaches just 20-30 minutes away — although you may prefer to cool off in the on-site pool. Because the two-floor house is split into two apartment-style units, it’s a perfect choice for two couples traveling together.

4. Cottonwood Cottage
[gallery ids="715579,715580,715581,715582,715583" size="full" type="slider"  /]

For a so-called cottage, this one-bedroom rental feels awfully roomy, especially if you take advantage of the private patio out back. It’s technically located in the town of Ballard — close to a historic schoolhouse dating to 1882 and a famous bakery called Bob’s Well Bread — but both Solvang and the Los Olivos wine country are easily reachable by bike. The owner lives on-site in the main house, but past guests have reported feeling perfectly secluded and undisturbed — you even get a separate entrance to feel fully at home.

5. Vintage Silver Bullet Trailer
[gallery ids="715584,715585,715586,715587,715588" size="full" type="slider"  /]

This adorable vintage Airstream is the perfect alternative to renting a whole ranch if you’re doing wine country on a budget. It has everything you need to be comfortable — including a two-burner stove, an open-air dining area, and a fire pit — although there are also a handful of great restaurants and wineries within walking distance. Tons more amenities await in Los Olivos, which is a quick bike ride away, and downtown Solvang is only a five-minute drive.

6. Trendy Farmstead Stay
[gallery ids="715589,715590,715591,715592,715593" size="full" type="slider"  /]

A few minutes from downtown Solvang, this spacious guest house sits on three idyllic acres where it's common to see goats, llamas, and horses roaming in the distance, as well as critters like rabbits and birds scampering around the backyard. The property feels like a world unto itself when you're lounging on the grill-equipped deck, gazing ahead at the rolling hills, but you're surprisingly close to all the best shops, restaurants, markets, bakeries, and tasting rooms in the area. With one king bed and two large twin beds, the house fits four people perfectly, which is the maximum number of guests the host will allow.

7. Carhartt Vineyard Retreat
[gallery ids="715597,715598,715599,715600,715601" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Bachelorette weekend, family reunion, couples getaway — this gorgeous three-bedroom vineyard house is ideal for special occasions. It's pricey for a small group, but if you fill all three bedrooms, you'll get a surprisingly good deal — plus a 20 percent discount if you stay for a week. Once you're checked in, there's a good chance you won't want to leave the property at all — who would when you have a jacuzzi, wood and gas grills, a pizza oven, a bocce court, a picnic area, a fireplace, a fully equipped kitchen, and all the modern audio-visual amenities.

8. Roaming Gnome Guest Ranch
[gallery ids="715619,715620,715621,715622,715623" size="full" type="slider"  /]

When it comes to Solvang Airbnbs, it doesn't get more central than this studio-sized rental. The unit belongs to the Roaming Gnome Guest Ranch, which specializes in mid-century cottages located just two blocks from Solvang's main drag and iconic windmill. Every unit has a private patio, as well as access to a shared yard with hammock chairs for lounging. At 275 square feet, the studio comfortably fits two guests, but the host is okay with squeezing in a family of three for an extra fee.

9. Anavo Farm Retreat
[gallery ids="715624,715625,715626,715627,715628" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Animal lovers, this one's for you. At this one-bedroom guest house in Ballard's wine country, guests share the property with goats, sheep, horses, and alpacas that you're welcome to get friendly with — there's even a designated feeding area in your private yard. (Guests also have access to a private garden.) Because of the animals, as well as features like the balcony and fire pit, only adults are allowed to stay the Anavo Farm Retreat, and the host enforces a two-guest maximum.

10. Olive Branch Farm Guest House
[gallery ids="715629,715630,715631,715632,715633" size="full" type="slider"  /]

The first thing you'll notice about this one-bedroom guest house in Ballard is the pool. The pool is solar-heated, meaning it gets chilly in the winter, but there's a hot tub available for year-round use, as well as a fire pit you can huddle around on colder nights. The second thing you'll notice about the property is that it never seems to end. It sits on five acres that guests are welcome to wander freely, complete with olive trees that create scenic spots to picnic. The house itself is chicly designed and well-appointed, although there's only a kitchenette with a microwave, refrigerator, and wet bar but no stove or oven.

11. Wine Country Ranch Home
[gallery ids="715634,715635,715636,715637,715638" size="full" type="slider"  /]

At first glance, this ranch house between Solvang and Los Olivos seems too big for solo travelers or small groups. It has three bedrooms, the dining table is set up for six, and the property spans 20 acres with room for cows and chickens. But the host invites anyone to enjoy the rustic yet refined home and has it priced accordingly: The base rate for a single traveler occupying one bedroom is $260 per night, and the total rate scales depending on how many people plan to visit. Because of its prime wine country location and, more importantly, the presence of livestock on the grounds, only guests ages 21 and are permitted to book.
