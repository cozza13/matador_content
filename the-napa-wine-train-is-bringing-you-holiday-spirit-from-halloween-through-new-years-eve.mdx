Fine wine and train rides are two things that simply go well together. All you have to do is look to the The Napa Valley Wine Train for proof of that (or the Grapevine, Texas, wine train, for that matter). This year, the premier wine drinking train in America’s premier wine destination is coming into the fall season with a lineup of holiday themed trips.
 
The track (36 miles round-trip) is located about 50 miles northeast of San francisco and was originally built in 1864 to shuttle people to the resorts in Calistoga. It starts in downtown Napa and passes 33 world-class vineyards, so you know there are views aplenty. The Napa Valley Wine Train has been steadily running as a passenger train to wineries since 1989. These days, as if the wine on restored antique train cars wasn’t a draw enough, intricate themes onboard match the season.
 
Here’s what the Napa Valley Wine Train has lined up for the rest of 2021:
 
Murder Mystery Tour: The Murder Mystery Company, which is the largest theatrical company in the country, is climbing aboard every weekend in October. They’ll host a two-hour wizards and witches murder mystery that people solve in between a multi-course gourmet meal (and yes, you can wear your own witch or wizard costume).
 
Thanksgiving ride: Skip laboring in the kitchen this Thanksgiving and instead leave it to the Wine Train chefs. Pumpkin bisque, turkey, rosemary and cracked black pepper beer, ricotta cheese gnocchi, and pumpkin-white chocolate mousse are on the menu. Naturally, you can expect a wine pairing better than the random assortment of bottles and boxes at your in-laws house.
 
Jingle + Mingle winter holiday rides: The Napa Valley Wine Train does it right and waits until after Thanksgiving to celebrate the December holidays. Starting November 25, the train is decked out in lights and holiday inspired cocktails (think: hot cider) join the drinks list. On December 18, 19, 23, and 24, musical acts and carolers will perform outside of the train station from 9:30 to 11 AM.
 
A Journey to the New Year: Bid adieu to the strange year of 2021 with an indulgent lunch. The afternoon service on the Gourmet Express and Vista Dome trains with have an upgraded menu on December 31, as well as a sparkling wine toast to warm you up for the bigger New Year toast later.[mn-post-ender]
