120,000 PASSENGERS move through San Francisco Airport (SFO) per day. Most of the in-transit passengers just shuffle to their next gate and wait out their layover slumped in a hard plastic chair. But you should consider going into the city for your layover. Whether you are a foodie, a culture vulture, or a kid at heart, San Francisco offers world class museums, hands-on fun, and a food scene almost sure to be better than your ultimate destination.

It will only take you 30 minutes on BART to get from SFO to downtown San Francisco. So, schedule yourself a long layover, head into SF, and take advantage of the following 15 things to do there.

&nbsp;
If you are a foodie
&nbsp;
1. Have breakfast at Tartine Bakery.

 Tartine BakerySan Francisco, United StatesThe best French bakery in the Mission, Tartine is famous for its scrumptious pastries. My favorites (because I can't choose just one) the quiche and the bread pudding (pictured here). If you come on the weekend, get ready to wait in line for about an hour. It's worth it.



Grab a coffee and morning bun from Tartine's well-stocked case. The bakery is the best in town, so be prepared to wait for a table. Alternatively, if it's a nice day, grab your breakfast to go and eat it on the grass at nearby Dolores Park.

BART stop: 24th Street, Mission
2. Check out the food stalls at the Ferry Building.
This Beaux Arts landmark is an actual, working ferry building. Its vaulted halls were lovingly restored in 2003 and re-purposed as a magnet for foodies and boozers. Some of the Ferry Building's uniquely local food items include an artistically hand-poured cuppa from Blue Bottle Coffee, the grilled cheese at the Cowgirl Sidekick, and the "secret breakfast" ice cream from Humphry Slocombe. Order it to find out what it is.

BART stop: Embarcadero
3. Eat street
Off the Grid organizes food truck flash mobs all over the Bay Area. Check their schedule for the day that you will be visiting or try to get there for lunch on Wednesdays at 5th &amp; Minna, Thursdays at the Ferry Building, or Fridays at the Civic Center.

BART stops: 5th &amp; Minna (Powell), Ferry Building (Embarcadero), Civic Center square (Civic Center)
4. Drink a local brew at Black Hammer Brewing.
Black Hammer Brewing has a rotating selection of 12 beers on tap. Express your own beer persona by ordering a pint of "Witless Zombie", "Sea Puppy", or "Blue Me". Get an early start at their happy hour (12 - 2 PM Mon-Sat) or check their calendar for special events.

BART stops:  ~1/2 mile south of either Powell or New Montgomery
5. Go big at La Taqueria.
San Francisco is known for assembling burritos as big as your head and La Taqueria offers up the best. None of this rice filler for them, just your choice of beans, meat, and salsa.

BART stop: 24th street Mission

San Francisco is home to a large Asian diaspora. The Asian Art Museum's collection serves to share the city’s diverse culture and history in over 18,000 pieces.

Union Square is known primarily for its high-end shopping, but the large plaza is also a music venue. The city sponsors a regular schedule of music that ranges from salsa, blues, roots, and swing. Feel free to get up and dance if the urge moves you because everything goes in San Francisco.

10. Take a walking tour of street art in The Mission.
San Francisco's Mission neighborhood has a proud Latino heritage on technicolor display. Walk down 16th street between Mission and Hampshire and you will see massive commissioned murals that tell the story of San Francisco's Latino immigrant experience. Be sure to duck down Balmy alley, and also check out Precita Eyes. They are a local nonprofit that supports Latino street art in the Mission.

11. Touch stuff at the Exploratorium.


The Exploratorium's stated mission is to "create inquiry-based experiences that transform learning worldwide." You can make electricity or examine live tide feeds from the bay. You can make your own optical illusions or toggle your own sound waves. All of it is interactive. Most everybody becomes a kid as soon as they step over the threshold.

BART stop: Embarcadero
12. Go to a Giants' Game.
The Giants' season runs from March to October. Baseball games run long but so plan for a long layover. The stadium is a classic brick ball field with scene stealing views of the bay. While there, go beyond the hot dog and treat yourself to fried chicken, chili, BBQ and tacos. Tickets run from $12 and up.

BART stop: Embarcadero. From there, walk 1 mile down the Embarcadero to the stadium.
13. Take a spin on the Creativity Carousel.
The Children’s Creativity Museum operates the historical LeRoy King carousel. It was originally built for San Francisco but due to the 1906 earthquake and other circumstances, it wasn’t installed there until 1998. While you take your $4 ride, squint your eyes and you can almost see 19th century San Francisco spinning by.

BART stop: Powell
14. Bowl a Lucky Strike.
Lucky Strike has a full food and drink menu and lounge areas in addition to the bowling lanes. It’s best to reserve in advance as it is a popular place, particularly during happy hour.
