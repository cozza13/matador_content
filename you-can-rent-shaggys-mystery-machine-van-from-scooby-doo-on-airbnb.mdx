Admit it -- you've always wanted to travel around in Shaggy's Mystery Machine from Scooby-Doo. Now, Airbnb is giving you the chance. The company has partnered with Matthew Lillard, who played Shaggy in the live-action film to rent the actual van used in the production. The Scooby-Doo Airbnb is parked in southern California, a stone's throw from the beach. What's more, rentals cost only $20 per night -- a nod to the film's 20th anniversary.

The catch is that you must act fast. Bookings open on June 16, and only three stays are available -- on June 24, 25, and 26. That said, each is quite the deal -- for $20 you get to stay in the van, decked out with lava lamps and a sound system bumping summer tunes. You'll be greeted by Lillard upon arrival, and you'll dine at an all-you-can-eat buffet featuring Shaggy and Scooby's favorite treats.

“I’ve been channeling Shaggy since the live-action adaptation in 2002, and he’s been a part of me ever since,” said Lillard. “I can’t wait to welcome guests into the world of the Mystery Inc. gang as their Airbnb Host and give them a summer vacation they’ll never forget…monsters not included!”

Guests will also be treated to a late-night rewatch of the film and get to play mystery games to challenge their own problem-solving skills. And there's no reason to cram inside the van for the duration of your stay -- outside the van will be a lounge setup worthy of Scooby's finest days.
