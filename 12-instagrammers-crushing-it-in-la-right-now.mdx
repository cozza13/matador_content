A sun-kissed surfer aesthetic, bright palettes, and an eye for clean design, this is pure Southern California eye candy.

    Bradbury, a Downtown LA icon, and by far one of the coolest interiors west of Chicago. A photo posted by Hunter Kerhart (@hunterkerhart) on Sep 25, 2015 at 10:39pm PDT

 
From museum of the moment -- The Broad -- to the classic Central Library, no great LA building is safe from this architectural photographer.

Angelenos and their rides.

    The ladies of @prismdjs know how to get people offa that thing. “Women make up less than ten percent of the DJ market, so males are taking 90 percent of that market,” she says. “I’m no feminist, but I think that there should be some equality here and if I can push that percentage up a little bit, I would be so happy.” Read the full story on our site.

In case you haven’t heard, Downtown LA is having a MAJOR MOMENT. This is the place to keep up with the neighborhood’s coolest, yummiest, and wackiest -- like the pharmacy selling magic healing candles, customized to your woes.

If you get IG Envy, you might want to skip this one. Blogger Olivia Lopez chronicles her charmed life in the city’s hippest restaurants, boutiques and Arts District lofts, donning a minimalist wardrobe that would make Audrey Hepburn weep.

    This photo was taken a few days before our life was turned sideways by the addition of our adorable little bird, Elliot. I can’t look at it without tearing up - his diaper, his lifted foot, how he was clutching his lovey for dear life and had no idea what really was about to happen. I’m happy to say he likes her as much out of my tummy as he did inside. Today on my way to work (I took an uber 12 miles which took over an hour) I wrote a personal post about how the first three weeks of having 2 kids under 2 has been. In short - its a game changer in a million different ways full of magical chaos.

This interior designer and TV host lets you snoop the city’s most creative homes. Which tend to have stylishly mismatched pillows. And a bit of an elephant theme.

If you based your LA weather knowledge on Rob Fissmer’s account, you’d think every day was overcast. But, surprise! It’s just the apt 70s filter he uses on his vintage rides, midcentury homes, and really cute kid.

If it’s arty or delicious, this culture vulture/foodie is THERE. Also… Fluffiest. Bichon. Ever.

Is this chick even real? If so, her life consists of poolside cocktails, interiors that look like Mad Men sets, and giant hats.

Jonpaul has more urban wildlife sightings than anyone I know. Question: How long did he have to wait to catch a flock of green parrots in downtown?
