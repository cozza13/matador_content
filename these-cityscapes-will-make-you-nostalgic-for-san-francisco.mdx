SAN FRANCISCO IS SO DISTINCTIVE and alluring to photographers (and us mortal human beings too) due to its location on the top of a peninsula, surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay. Natural beauty aside, letâ€™s not forget the Golden Gate Bridge and the Transamerica Pyramid skyscraper, both of which have helped create an incomparable city skyline.
