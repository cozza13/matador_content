Staying close to the entrance of Joshua Tree National Park is essential, not only for easy access to the park but also because the location is darn right cool. The desert landscape and dark skies make for a stunning backdrop to some of America’s best-designed Airbnbs. This sprawling two-bedroom Retrograde Retreat Joshua Tree is testament to this. The Airbnb sleeps six and comes with a private outdoor saloon.

About Retrograde Retreat Joshua Tree

The retreat is not just a place to rest after a day exploring the national park. It is a private outdoor playground. We are talking an outdoor swimming pool with a glass front built from a shipping container, two hot tubs, hammocks, an outdoor amphitheater, and yes, your very own desert-style bar.

The first bedroom is a queen, and the second has two double beds so we'll leave it up to your group who gets the private option. That said, there's also an outdoor hanging daybed where you can snuggle and enjoy the famed dark skies.

And if you've had enough of the dusty desert you can retreat inside and relax in the Airbnb's sprawling indoor living areas that have all the modern amenities and technology you'd expect from a new-build home.

What to do near Retrograde Retreat

One of the great things about Joshua Tree National Park is that it’s very easy to explore on your own. Unlike other national parks, you don’t strictly have to stick to the officially marked paths. If you see something that looks interesting you can pull over and explore. 

Here are some basic safety tips for visiting the park. 


	During summer months time is of the essence -- hikes are advised to be done either before 10:00 AM or after 5:00 PM when temperatures drop.
Drinking lots of water during a visit is essential. Do not assume there will be lots of access points within the park
You should never hike off the beaten path alone.
Stay vigilant for venomous creatures. [mn-post-ender]
