If you and your friends ever wanted to take a full-day wine tour, but can’t seem to agree on a designated driver, Uber is here to solve all your transportation problems. UberWINE is the ride-hailing app’s latest offering in California’s San Luis Obispo wine region, and it makes getting to and from the tasting party a whole lot easier.

Booking UberWINE is similar to the process of booking any other Uber ride. Get on the app and request WINE or WINEXL. You’ll be paired with a driver who will stick with you throughout your tour, chauffeuring you and your group from one winery to the next throughout San Luis Obispo’s wine country.

The app has even partnered with five local wineries to offer $10 off a bottle at each stop, meaning your planning is completely taken care of. All you have to do is round up your friends with the tempting offer of an afternoon of tasting wines and cruising around the Santa Ynez Valley, far away from the tourist-laden Napa Valley and its sky-high prices. A four-stop SLO wine country itinerary could look like this:

 	Start your adventure over a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon at Villa San Juliette Winery. This is the northernmost and furthest from the city of San Luis Obispo, so starting here ensures that you don’t get too sauced at the other spots and never make it up there.
 	Take your UberWINE south to Peachy Canyon Winery Tasting Room, on the outskirts of the town of Templeton. Here, have your server pop open a bottle of the perfectly blended 2015 Westside.
 	A few minutes away is Castoro Cellars. Relax over a bottle of 2015 Grenache.
 	Conclude your tour with the refreshing 2016 Pinot Grigio at Donati Family Vineyard. Don’t forget to grab a couple bottles for the hotel room, of course.

All four wineries offer the UberWINE discount, available by asking your server for the special Uber discount code. Once you have it, plug it into the "promotions" area of the app, then show the server the confirmation that appears on your phone. The service is also available from Santa Barbara, for those further south. Happy sipping! [mn-post-ender]
