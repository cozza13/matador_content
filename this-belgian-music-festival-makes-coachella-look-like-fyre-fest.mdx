Music festivals have been around long before the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival became known as the creme de la creme. Every year, people flock to California's desert wearing meticulously planned Instagram-worthy festival gear for three days of amazing acts and beautiful sculptures on multiple stages. However, Michelle Gonzalez, a luxury travel influencer, recently posted a TikTok singing praises of the music festival Tomorrowland in Belgium, saying that it's so superior that it "makes Coachella look like Fyre Fest."

  @laxtoluxury This music festival makes Coachella look like Fyre Fest! &#x1f602; #tomorrowland #festival #musicfestival #festivalseason #traveltips #luxurytravel #coachella #laxtoluxury #learnontiktok â™¬ Festival(262774) - TimTaj   

Tomorrowland is a Belgian electronic dance music festival held in Boom, Flanders, Belgium since 2005. If you think Coachella garners a large crowd, Tomorrowland is known for attracting people from over 200 countries, making it an exceptionally culturally diverse experience. And after two years of hosting a digital festival because of the pandemic, EDM lovers are stoked to return to the five-day festival known for the production value that it puts into its yearly themes. 

Tomorrowland is paired with Dreamville, where festival-goers eat, sleep, and live. It's a part of the immersive experience the festival sets out to create for visitors. To start, Tomorrowland and Dreamville have their own currency called Pearls. The event is completely cashless, so when you receive your wristband, you'll go online and load it up with money to spend at the facilities. Lodging options range from the typical bring-your-own-tent set-up you'll find at other music festivals to the Terra Solis Room -- a lockable suite with all of the amenities of a regular hotel room plus breakfast included, a 24-hour bar, a private pool and garden, and free massages, make-up, and hair styling. Dreamville is outfitted with international food experiences. You'll find everything from regular festival food to high-class restaurants -- plus markets, jewelry stores, hair and makeup salons, and more. 

There are day passes, but a three-day pass starts at $272. Tickets for this year's festival in July 2022 are entirely sold out, but keep an eye out for 2023. [mn-post-ender]
