I meet with my travel buddy Ryan in California. The original plan is to get to the awe-inspiring landscapes of Yosemite National Park, but something else lands on our radar. After some research, we find some incredible images of the lesser known Kennedy Meadows and Relief Reservoir about four hours north. This leads us to alter our plans and head on a quick overnight backpacking trip into the northern California wilderness. Itâ€™s my first time backpacking in California, and I can only imagine what this hike has in store for us. [mn-post-ender]
