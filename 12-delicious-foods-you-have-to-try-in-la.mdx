    "I ordered a 'double double burger' and they gave me 'double double double double burger'." #ChitoLA #innout #losangeles #doubledoubleanimalstyle #doubledoubledoubledouble #burger #burgers #burgersandfries #cheeseburgers #cheeseburger #cheeseburgerheaven #arcosfamLA2015 A photo posted by DJ TernAround (@tokadisko) on Sep 10, 2015 at 4:41pm PDT


Sometimes, I’ll order the most complex secret menu combination I can, because a smug sense of being “in the know” is actually a better seasoning than their secret sauce by itself.

 2. Philippe’s French Dip Sandwich 

    Only reason I don't hate LA #Phillipes #hotbeefsandwich #ilovefood A photo posted by Chris Russell (@cuzimcr) on Aug 12, 2015 at 2:39pm PDT


You may prefer Cole’s, the other restaurant claiming to have invented it. I mean, you’d be wrong, but the option is there.

 3. Roscoe’s Chicken and Waffles 

    Lunch with the squad. &#x1f423; &#x1f4f7; @JustJohnV #Roscoes #Eeeeeats #Foodie #RoscoesChickenAndWaffles A photo posted by Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles (@roscoesofficial) on Jul 13, 2015 at 1:12pm PDT


It doesn’t make sense. Shit, I’ve eaten there countless times, and I still don’t get how chicken and waffles could possibly be a good breakfast combination. But I’ve learned to stop questioning it, and just shove it in my mouth as fast as possible.

 4. Bottomless mimosas at the Churchill

Bottomless mimosas are a Los Angeles tradition -- they’re what you drink on Sunday when you want to trick yourself into thinking you’re being healthy as you skip yoga class because you’re too hungover.

 5. Korean BBQ from the Kogi food truck

If you’ve ever seen the mouth-watering movie, Chef, and decided you were starving for some beautiful food, you owe it to Roy Choi, the chef who both inspired the movie and created its menu. That makes Kogi, his own truck, the most Hollywood food you could possibly find.

 6. Any other food truck you can find 

    Thank you for the love as always Granada Hills. We are clean and out! Banzai!!! A photo posted by Jogasaki Sushi Burrito (@jogasakiburrito) on Aug 23, 2013 at 9:24pm PDT


We really like food we have to work for. It’s like Anti-Delivery. 

 7. Homegrown Donuts

There’s a reason Los Angeles is one of the last bastions Dunkin’ Donuts has never been able to invade. The city is so full of mom ‘n pop donut shops that that corporate glaze just cannot compete.

 8. Anything from the Grove Farmer’s Market 

    The Butcher. Mike has been in #LA for over 40 years, and he's still a hardworking man at 80. #portrait #meat #butcher A photo posted by Sheila Barabad (@sheilabarabad) on Jan 18, 2015 at 6:02am PST


There’s something beautiful about being able to buy the finest, humanely-raised meats right next to stand that sells hot sauce called “The Anus Pickler.”

 9. Some GMO food across the street from a Farmer’s Market

Half of LA believes GMO foods are magically bad for them, and the other half is dead set on mocking those people into the ground.

 10. Thai food from NIGHT+MARKET

There’s always some hip restaurant of the month in Los Angeles, but this one comes with a chef rated as one of the best new guys in the country. Show up and get some instant street cred before everybody knows you’re a tourist.

 11. Bartender’s choice at The Varnish 

    "The way to drink a cocktail is quickly, while it's still laughing at you." A photo posted by The Varnish (@thevarnishbar) on Oct 29, 2013 at 11:44am PDT


If you can hunt down the speakeasy-style bar, don’t worry about the menu. Just tell them to surprise you. They know more about alcohol than you.

 12. The Godmother from Bay Cities Deli 

    If you don't know, now you know. Bay Cities is life&#x1f44c;&#x1f3fd; #thegodmother A photo posted by Mimi &#x1f338; (@mims_) on Aug 21, 2015 at 3:16pm PDT


You know a sandwich is good when you can cut your mouth on the crust of the bread and still come back for more over and over. [mn-post-ender]
