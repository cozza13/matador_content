IF YOU THOUGHT 3-D was only good for showing off science fiction worlds, take a look at this timelapse.

Of course, you'll need some of the old-school 3-D glasses to make it work. The new type you boosted from the theater aren't going to cut it. Once I finally found some approved eyewear, I did notice the cars moved around me a little more realistically. 

As I virtually cruised through the California countryside, I caught myself imagining watching a 3-D video of dune-bashing in Dubai or ripping ski-turns through a tight tree line. I'd probably crap myself watching a 3-D view of driving through the traffic of Ho Chi Minh City. 

While this video eases a person into the 3-D travel video experience, I can't wait to see where this technology takes me next.
