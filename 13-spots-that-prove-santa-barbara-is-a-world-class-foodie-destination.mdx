Located within the Bacara Resort & Spa and overlooking the Santa Barbara coastline, sits Angel Oak. This modern steak and seafood restaurant is run by classically-trained Parisian Executive Chef Vincent Lesage. The menu includes items such as Santa Barbara's famous local uni, as well as items from the certified Kobe and dry-aged beef program. At the bar, order the California Lookout, using California-produced citrus vodka, or choose from one of the 12,000 bottles from the wine cellar. Whether a special occasion or an after-dinner dessert and glass of wine, Angel Oak will not disappoint for those looking for local ingredients paired with innovative techniques.

Recently opened in the new Waterline mixed-use space in Santa Barbara's Funk Zone neighborhood, Nook offers redefined soul food with global inspirations. Owned by Master Chef Norbert Schulz, who first opened Norbert's in Santa Barbara 35 years ago. Since then, they've opened and been partners of more than five other restaurants in the city. Nook is their newest venture and features high-quality food in a casual setting. Menu items include a Duck Foie Gras Burger, House Made Bratwurst, and Purple Potatoe Waffle & Fried Chicken. Nook shares the same space as brewery Lama Dog, so there will always be a great beer to pair with chef Norbert's German pretzels.

While Yoichi's has been in Santa Barbara almost one year, they are still converting newcomers to the concept of kaiseki, i.e. traditional, multi-course Japanese dinner. The intention of kaiseki is meticulous preparation to showcase each ingredient in its pure form, so the item tastes as it is intended to by nature. Chef Yoichi Kawabata and wife Mogi Kawabata are serving up a seven-course kaiseki dinner for $100, using seasonal ingredients cooked in traditional Japanese fashion. The courses offered include appetizers, soup, sashimi, a grilled dish, a steamed and simmered dish, sushi and dessert. To pair, they offer a curated menu of sake, beer, and wine. 

5. The Lark

Since 2013, they have been serving locally-sourced and responsibly grown cuisine from the Central Coast.

Come here to get your seafood fix while watching sailboats coming in to dock for the night at sunset. We splurged on the king crab (among other things!) and it was perfect.
