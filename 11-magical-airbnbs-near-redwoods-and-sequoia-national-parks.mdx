See the tallest trees on Earth with a visit to California’s coastal redwoods in Redwood and Sequoia National Parks. The Golden State is the only place in the world where you can view groves of these ancient conifers, and it’s worth traversing the northern part of the state to see a variety of these giant trees. Instead of pitching a tent in a national park, stay nearby in private luxury at these Redwoods and Sequoia National Park Airbnb properties for couples, friends, and families.

1. A rustic underground hobbit house built into the mountainside
[caption id="attachment_662626" align="alignnone" width="1280"] Photo: Airbnb[/caption]

Adventurous travelers who aren’t afraid of roughing it will love this underground hobbit hole for two. Located in a remote, off-grid eco-village in Del Norte County’s Smith River Canyon, the property is accessible via the scenic Redwood Highway (CA-199). While running water is available, electricity is not, but candlelit nights make for a romantic outdoorsy getaway. The common kitchen and bath are shared with the community, but you’ll have a private sleep sanctuary on the round love nest bed.

This rugged experience isn’t for everyone, as roads to reach the destination are winding and rough to navigate. But if you make the trip, you’ll love exploring the forest, streams, and waterfalls of the surrounding forested land. Unwind after a day outdoors in the wood-fired sauna, or hang with the chickens, goats, dogs, and woodland creatures that call this commune home.

Enjoy easy access to the beach and magical redwoods with a coastal stay in this 1968 Airstream trailer near Arcata, one of the most charming Airbnbs near Redwoods National Park.

There’s WiFi if you’re working from home, and an outdoor deck to relax on when the sun goes down.

The trailer is permanently parked near sandy dunes and a beach -- a 30-minute drive to Redwood National and State Parks. While tiny, this retreat includes a queen and twin bed plus a private bathroom and shower. You can even bring along Fido for a $25 pet fee.
