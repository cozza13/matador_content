WHATEVER IDEAS I HAD ABOUT OAKLAND before my trip, my perspective was forever changed within the span of three days. My fianc√©e and I spent an unforgettable weekend in the East Bay last month, getting a feel for exactly what this city has to offer.

Day 1 was all about First Friday, the monthly festival of art, food, and music that takes place on Telegraph Ave. On Saturday, we made our way down to Lake Merritt for a morning walk and watched the fog burn off to reveal blue skies above the cityscape. We ended the day eating barbecue and being utterly impressed by the urban dance competition at the Art + Soul Festival downtown. And on Sunday, we lost ourselves in the incredible Farmers Market in Jack London Square, surrounded by delicious, locally sourced, organic food, and a lot of friendly people who were more than happy to share with us what makes the city great.

It was a full three days, but at the same time not nearly enough time -- we'll be back, Oakland. [mn-post-ender]
