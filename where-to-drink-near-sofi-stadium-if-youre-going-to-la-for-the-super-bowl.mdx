It’s early February, and that can only mean one thing. Well, yes, Valentine’s Day is creeping up painfully quickly. But it also means the Super Bowl is near: Sunday, February 13 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. Whether you’re deeply invested in the LA Rams or the Cincinnati Bengals, or you’re just in it for the prop bets and squares, the Big Game is basically a universally acknowledged excuse to gather at your favorite bar. 

If you’re lucky enough to be going to the Super Bowl to experience the event in person, you’ll need to come prepared with a solid roster of bars and breweries in the area. We got in touch with Denise Ramirez from Common Space Brewery, located just a handful of miles from the stadium, who collaborated with her team to suggest the best bars near SoFi Stadium to drink at before, during, and after the Super Bowl.

For brewery lovers: Common Space Brewery

We’d be remiss if we didn’t start with Common Space Brewery. Just a 10-minute drive from SoFi Stadium, Common Space Brewery has been a neighborhood staple since 2018. The beer garden and taproom are open seven days a week, and rotating food trucks serve up everything from hot dogs and tacos to cupcakes. They also host trivia nights every Tuesday, and a free comedy show each month. But of course, it’s all about the beer. Common Space is known for its Chubby Unicorn hazy IPA, Neon Boogie West Coast IPA, and Natural Rise light lager. 

Address: 3411 W El Segundo Blvd, Hawthorne, CA 90250

For a block party atmosphere: Lil Simmzy's

Lil Simmzy’s is known for being a spot with amazing food, a great beer selection, and a classic SoCal vibe. The restaurant features outdoor seating under striped patio umbrellas, and serves up a wide selection of craft beers and, this being a California spot next to the beach, fish tacos. You’ll feel like you’re at a block party rather than a restaurant, and on Super Bowl Sunday, that’s exactly what you want. 

Address: 850 S. Pacific Coast Highway, El Segundo CA, 90245

For delicious Mexican food, craft beer, and margaritas: Cinco

For an amazing selection of craft beer, delicious Mexican food, and great happy hour deals, Cinco is your spot. The restaurant serves up Oaxacan-inspired Mexican food, and the bar menu heavily emphasizes agave spirits. From tinga taquitos and ceviche to happy hour margaritas, you really can’t go wrong here. 

Address: 7241 West Manchester Avenue, Los Angeles CA, 90046

For quick and reliable food and drinks: Eureka!

Eureka! is located right off the tarmac of the regional Hawthorne Airport, and it has a great selection of food, specialty cocktails, and craft beers with plenty of TVs to catch the action. The tasting kitchen specializes in all-American classics like burgers, but it’s also known for the rotating beer program, small batch whiskey, and robust breakfast menu. 

Address: 12101 Crenshaw Boulevard, Hawthorne, CA 90250

For when you can’t escape the airport: Renaissance Hotel LAX 

Travelers just landing in the area are probably in a hurry to get far away from the airport as soon as possible. But if escaping isn’t in the cards for you when game time starts, or if you’re just passing through and don’t have time to make it into the city, the Renaissance Airport hotel at LAX makes for a more than serviceable stopping point. The hotel’s bar, Studio 12, is the perfect mix of sports bar and chic cocktail lounge. Offering a wide selection of handcrafted cocktails, craft beer, and wine, you’ll forget you’re still at the airport.  

Address: 9620 Airport Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90045[mn-post-ender]
