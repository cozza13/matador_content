We've all gawked at viral videos of uber-cool people sabering a Champagne bottle. And now it's your chance to shine and give your TikTok followers a real show. The St. Regis San Francisco has launched a private Champagne sabrage masterclass where you can learn the craft from an expertly trained St. Regis Butler. 

St. Regis Hotels & Resorts has a long-standing tradition of sabrage. The ritual began at the hotel in 1904 when John Jacob Astor IV, the founder of the chain, would put on a show every evening to close out the day and welcome the night -- in style.  

The classes are open to guests and locals and the private tuition can be tailored for an individual or group of friends. 

“For many guests, our signature Art of Sabrage service presented each evening in The St. Regis San Francisco Bar is a highlight of the stay, and we are delighted to be able to share a ritual that is so central to the brand identity with the local community as well,” said Roger Huldi, general manager at The St. Regis San Francisco. “With our new private champagne sabrage masterclasses, we hope to spread the glamour, style, and excitement synonymous with champagne sabering with anyone curious about this cherished St. Regis tradition.”

Perfect for a bachelorette party, or a special birthday the 30-minute masterclass costs around $500 for a group of four. For that price, you'll get your expert training, a bottle of Moet & Chandon Champagne, canapes, and a few new followers on social media. 

Reservations must be made at least 48 hours in advance and can be done by contacting the butler at sanfrancisco.butler@stregis.com via email. [mn-post-ender]
