A weekend away is the perfect cap to a hectic week. Few major American metropolises are better positioned to escape the traffic and chaos of the urban environment than the San Francisco Bay Area, where you can go from wine country to the coast to mountainous backcountry -- all within the currently mandated 120-mile radius. And escaping the city doesn’t even have to break the bank. These unique Airbnb properties are remote and affordable.

Before we begin, let’s cover the basics. You want to relax in quiet solitude and not listen to people talk through the wall -- so each of these rentals is an entire building or separated unit. You also only have a weekend and don’t want to spend half of it driving, so each is within two hours of San Francisco. Beyond those two commonalities, these properties for weekend getaways from San Francisco are as diverse as they come.

We hope you love the spaces and stays we recommend! Just so you know, Matador may collect a small commission from the links on this page if you decide to book a stay, and listed prices are accurate as of the time of publication.

Weekend getaways in Marin County
Fairy Garden Cottage, Novato
[caption id="attachment_633166" align="alignnone" width="1280"] Photo: Airbnb[/caption]

Price: $110/night
Distance from city: 45 minutes

Bring outdoor adventure and an artistic lifestyle together at the Fairy Garden Cottage, without going as far as Petaluma. The property is surrounded by gardens to inspire -- whether that be words, paint, or what have you -- and after the creativity has poured out you can relax in the private hot tub. The host, Teri, even puts the B&amp;B in Airbnb by offering a locally sourced breakfast to her guests for an additional charge. The art garden itself is perfect for enjoying a bottle in quiet, but if you want to indulge further, many of Napa’s wineries are less than an hour away.
Airstream Bnb on Magical Property, Petaluma
[caption id="attachment_633167" align="alignnone" width="1280"] Photo: Airbnb[/caption]

Price: $85/night
Distance from city: 50 minutes

Airstream trailers are to road-tripping what Willie Mays is to the Giants -- it just doesn’t get any better. Thing is, Airstreams are not cheap. So how about traveling to one, instead of traveling in one? At this Petaluma spot, wilderness abounds, and depending on the time of year, you may be able to glean fruit from the blackberry bushes behind the trailer. Just don’t plan to enjoy a hot cup of tea with them as the trailer only runs cold water (hot water and a full bathroom are provided inside the host’s home).
Weekend getaways in the Wine country
Rose Garden Charmer, Petaluma
[caption id="attachment_633168" align="alignnone" width="1280"] Photo: Airbnb[/caption]

Price: $150/night
Distance from city: One hour

Wine tastes best when you’re surrounded by beautiful flowers, lush hill country, and a Victorian aesthetic. The Rose Garden Charmer offers all three, with Sonoma County wine country as your backdrop. The gardens that envelope this studio are home to more than 8,000 rose bushes, a koi pond, and additional flora, and feature romantic trellised walkways. Inside, take in the charm from the clawfoot bathtub, glass in hand.
Wine Country Guest Cottage, Santa Rosa
[caption id="attachment_633169" align="alignnone" width="1280"] Photo: Airbnb[/caption]

Price: $350/night
Distance from city: Just over an hour

This one’s a bit of a splurge, but it’s more than worth it if you are looking for weekend getaways from San Francisco. The Wine Country Guest Cottage is like a mini-resort in the heart of wine country. From the onsite fire pit, take in views of the surrounding valley, and after returning from wine touring soak in the in-pool spa. Sunsets are key here, so do your touring during the afternoon and grab a bottle to go. As an added bonus, you’re only 25 minutes from the coast, and that 25 minutes is populated by rolling hills and vineyards.
House on the Hill with Views, Napa Valley
[caption id="attachment_633170" align="alignnone" width="1280"] Photo: Airbnb[/caption]

Price: $222/night
Distance from city: Just over an hour

This one’s perfect for an affordable group getaway. House on the Hill with Views, where the name is both simple and all-encompassing, is essentially a farm stay and a wine country basecamp rolled into one. The listing boasts “several” decks and patios on which to enjoy a glass of wine, surrounded by the vineyards on which it was produced, and when dinner beckons you can either cook onsite in the gourmet kitchen or head 10 minutes into Napa proper.
Majestic views of Sonoma wine country, Sonoma
[caption id="attachment_633171" align="alignnone" width="1200"] Photo: Airbnb[/caption]

Price: $329/night
Distance from city: 50 minutes

Get up high near Sonoma with this “cabin” that’s really a full-on mountain house. With incredible views of the valley below, this wine country retreat sleeps up to eight guests and is ideal for family, group, and team-building getaways. You’re surrounded by an acre of privacy but can bike or drive to Sonoma Square in minutes. The property and its epic deck offer Sonoma views and plenty of space to lounge, play games, or just relax inside in a home that actually blends rustic and modern quite well.
Weekend getaways near the Pacific Coast Highway
Venture Retreat Yurt, Pescadero

Price: $327/night
Distance from city: 1.5 hours

Venture Retreat Yurt serves dual purposes. It’s a place to crash, yes, but it’s also a spot to recharge with space for an entire yoga retreat or mindfulness workshop. If a weekend with the crew to workshop resolutions and set intentions is in order, this yurt is the best place to do it anywhere on the Pacific Coast Highway. The host’s property also includes a hot tub and pool, yours to use as long as another retreat hasn’t rented them out privately. The ocean is nearby and the yurt is heated by a wood-burning fireplace.
The Big Om Ocean Retreat, Pescadero
[caption id="attachment_633173" align="alignnone" width="1280"] Photo: Airbnb[/caption]

Price: $450/night on weekends, $175/night on weeknights
Distance from city: 1.5 hours

This dome house, also in Pescadero, is right near the beach, has onsite horses, and is surrounded by ocean views. It also allows you to have plenty of space to recharge even if you come with a group (the dome sleeps up to 16 people, making the price point much more approachable). The retreat is off-grid and offline, so you won’t be tempted to check in and see what’s going on back home or have the constant temptation to Face-brag about where you’re spending the weekend.
Weekend getaways South of San Francisco
Tranquility Base Redwood Mountain Treehouse, Felton
[caption id="attachment_633174" align="alignnone" width="1280"] Photo: Airbnb[/caption]

Price: $198/night
Distance from city: 1.5 hours

The Tranquility Base Redwood Mountain Treehouse puts you in a treehouse with the most incredible deck you’ve ever had access to. There’s a hot tub, multiple lounge areas, and a fire pit. It’s literally in the forest, so you’re up among the trees with the birds, and nearby is ample outdoor recreation at Henry Cowell’s State Park, Loch Lomond Rec Area, the Felton Covered Bridge Park, and more. If ever there were a secluded writer’s haven near the Bay for weekend getaways from San Francisco, this is it.
Sanctuary in Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve, Los Gatos
[caption id="attachment_633175" align="alignnone" width="1280"] Photo: Airbnb[/caption]

Price: $250/night
Distance from city: One hour

This entire cabin has cool steampunk vibes. It’s also minutes from San Jose, meaning you can bounce from your tech job and still enjoy happy hour in the middle of nowhere before watching the city lights overtake the horizon. In the morning, hit the nearby hiking trails, stretch out on the yoga swing, or lounge by the pool that is shared with an adjacent Airbnb rental on the other side of the massive property. The views from everywhere are dramatic while the inside is rustic and isolationist. Truly a place of contrasts. [mn-post-ender]
