Ever since I heard of Slab City -- a self-governed community located in the middle of the desert in southern California -- I’d been curious as to what living here was really like. It’s been described as “the last free place in America” because there are no rules and no laws. I'd always heard that it’s a bunch of squatters, hippies, and homeless people. I spent a night here and learned that, although this is partially true, many Slabbers are also just your average, everyday people, simply wanting to get away from it all. [mn-post-ender]
