If cannabis is your thing, Airbnb has partnered with Sonoma Hills Farm to give you an experience you'll never forget. You could be one of three lucky people to bring a friend on an adventure to live the high life by booking a cannabis farm stay in Petaluma, California, for just $60 per night (a reference to the farm's 60 acres).

This Airbnb is unlike any others. Cannabis lovers will be able to put their green thumb to the test while on the farm. The property offers 360-degree views of the rolling rural hills from the modern farmhouse with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a gorgeous private pool. They'll also be able to make friends with permanent residents of the property: Curly Sue the Mangalitsa pig and Tony the Highland cow. There's also no wifi on the property, prompting visitors to completely disconnect and become one with their natural surroundings.

Guests will spend time learning and participating in the farm's planting season and maybe even dig a hole for a cannabis plant or two. They can then head to the stunning farmhouse kitchen with stainless steel appliances to prepare meals with fresh produce and hemp straight from plants in the property's garden. After dinner, enjoy what quiet rural California offers while stargazing around the wood-burning fire pit. Enjoy a curated selection of CBD products from brands like Green Bee Botanicals, Potli, Rose Los Angeles, and Jane West, and candles from Garden Society to help you unwind.

"Our goal is to normalize growing hemp and cannabis by demonstrating it's just like any other plant, with benefits to both humans and the earth. By offering an insider's look into how we carefully cultivate our products — be they vegetables or cannabis strains — we hope to offer a stay that's equal parts relaxing and enriching," said Airbnb Host and Sonoma Hills Farm's chief cannabis cultivator Aaron Keefer in a statement. "By connecting with the land, guests will leave with a different perspective than when they arrived and will have supported our farm in a meaningful way."

In honor of this specialty Airbnb stay with Sonoma Hills Farm, Airbnb will donate to Regeneration International to support their mission to reverse global warming and end world hunger by facilitating and accelerating the global transition to regenerative agriculture and land management.

The three one-night stays will occur from Saturday, April 30, to Tuesday, May 3, exclusively for California residents 21 and older. If you're interested, you'll have to be quick! Booking for these exclusive one-night stays will open on April 20 at 10:00 AM PDT. [mn-post-ender]
