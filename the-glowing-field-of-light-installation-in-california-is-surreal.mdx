It may look like a field of fireflies or something out of a fantasy movie, but it’s actually the latest (and largest) installation of artist Bruce Munro’s “Field of Light.” Gracing the Paso Robles' Sensorio gardens in California, the installation includes over 58,000 glowing stemmed spheres connected by solar-powered, fiber-optic strands. 

Visitors can wander the paths through the installation, and watch as the colors change in a surreal spectacle of light. Munro is a former commercial lighting designer, so this certainly isn’t his first foray into the world of illumination. He was inspired by visiting Uluru, in Australia’s Northern Territory, and created his first “field of light” in the early 2000s. In this case, the lights were assembled by a team in the UK before being shipped to the US and planted among the hills. Munro’s created similar installations in Arizona, Australia, Scotland, Denmark, and South Korea. 

“It’s really like being a painter,” he told the San Francisco Chronicle, “but your canvas is the landscape and you’re working on a slightly different scale. It’s almost like three-dimensional impressionism. It’s this gentle pointillist landscape of rippling color.”

You can visit the Paso Robles installation from May 19 until January 5, 2020. General admission costs between $18 and $24, with VIP tickets reaching up to $125. [mn-post-ender]
