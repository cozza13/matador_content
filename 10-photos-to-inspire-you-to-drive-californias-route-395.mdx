THERE IS THE CALIFORNIA we’ve all come to know and love ­­the West Coast with its sun-­kissed sand and colorful cities, its celebrated beaches and celebrity culture. Then there is the “other California” -- the backbone of the state -- the darker alter ­ego to California’s glittering coast. Here, where the Sierra Nevada’s silhouette is speckled with sweet smelling pine trees, where the fog hangs thickly over a moody palette of blue­gray lakes. The scenery changes swiftly -- from fairy tale­-like views to desolate ghost towns to rolling sand dunes and striped canyons. Route 395 stretches from the Canadian border to Los Angeles, cutting a clear path through the Sierra Nevada mountains and Death Valley. [mn-post-ender]
