OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, Matador has published articles, photography, and video that show exactly what makes Oakland great. We've looked at the remarkable ethnic and cultural diversity of the East Bay; we've charted a week in the nightlife of the city; we've showcased the one-of-a-kind art and architecture on display; we've even mapped 30 incredible places located less than a four-hour drive from Oakland.

In the process, we've come across countless images that do a wonderful job of depicting the spirit of the city, and which have stayed in our minds for their beauty and inspiration. Here are 21 of our favorite. [mn-post-ender]
