Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is located just south of Venice Beach, a central location that separates it from the trend of major cities building airports far outside of city centers. For travelers, this means the city is right there (though, it takes battling LA traffic to access it). Staying at hotels near Los Angeles Airport puts you close to the terminal as well as the beach and attractions -- making these properties a sure win for business trips, solo travel, and for travelers basing themselves in LA before or after heading up or down the coast. These are the best Los Angeles airport hotels.
