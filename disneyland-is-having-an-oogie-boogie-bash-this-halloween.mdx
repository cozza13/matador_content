Fans of The Nightmare Before Christmas will want to mark their calendars for September 17. Disney California Adventure will be hosting the Oogie Boogie Bash, a Halloween party with a Tim Burton-esque dose of macabre. The bash is intended for all ages, costumes are encouraged, and yes, booze will be sold.

Guests will be able to enjoy “Mickey’s Trick or Treat,” a Halloween show featuring Mickey and his pals, as well as a “DescenDANCE Party” based on the Descendants movie trilogy. Each night of the bash will also feature “Treat Trails,” where guests can collect bags full of candy to bring home. Among the most exciting new additions to the festivities is the “Villainous!” performance, full of lasers, projections, and lightning. Of course, there’ll also be a Halloween parade with Mickey, his pals, and Disney villains, as well as character encounters throughout the park.

The Oogie Boogie Bash will be running for over a month, on select nights between September 17 and October 31. Separate park admission is required, with tickets costing between $110 and $145 per person. [mn-post-ender]
