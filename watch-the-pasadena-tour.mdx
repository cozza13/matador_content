This isn't particularly fair. Pasadena is a vibrant city in its own right, with a truly incredible culture. There's the Norton Simon Museum, for example, a world-class art museum that's home to Van Goghs, Rembrandts, Picassos, Warhols, and Cezannes, among others. There's the one-of-a-kind architectural wonder that is Gamble House. There's one of the more beautiful City Halls in the country. There's the One Colorado open-air shopping mall, the charming Rose Bowl Flea Market, and coffee shops like Intelligentsia (which may very well be hipster heaven). There are incredible restaurants like the Mediterranean-themed Cafe Santorini. 

You get the idea: Pasadena has way too much too offer -- and is way too distinct -- to be lumped in with the rest of the LA metroplex. So we shot this stop-motion video of some of our favorite spots in town. We hope you check it out:
