Half Dome is an iconic granite dome in Yosemite National Park, California. It is a popular destination for hikers and backpackers, offering stunning views of the park and a challenging climb to the summit. To hike Half Dome, you must obtain a permit through a lottery system. The lottery opens in March and closes in April, with permits becoming available for purchase in May. Only 300 permits are available daily, and the hike is only allowed from May to October.

The hike to Half Dome is a strenuous 16-mile round trip with an elevation gain of 4,800 feet. The trailhead is located at the Happy Isles Trailhead, and the first part of the hike is a moderate climb up the Mist Trail. After reaching the top of Vernal and Nevada Falls, the trail becomes steeper and rockier as you approach the base of Half Dome. The final ascent to the summit of Half Dome is a steep climb up a series of granite steps and cables. The cables are fixed to the rock and give hikers a handhold as they make their way up the steep slope. The climb can be challenging, especially for those not comfortable with heights, but the views from the top are well worth it.

It is important to note that hikers must be in good physical condition and properly equipped to attempt the hike. Be prepared for the weather, and bring enough food and water.

Half Dome is one of the most popular hikes in Yosemite National Park, and for good reason. The hike offers a challenging climb, stunning views, and an unforgettable experience. If you're up for the challenge, be sure to plan ahead and secure your permit in advance. Good luck. [mn-post-ender]
