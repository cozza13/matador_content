I visited Salvation Mountain not knowing a whole lot about it. I had seen pictures and so I knew it was a colorful mountain in the middle of the desert, with religious phrases written all over. I left realizing that it was, above all, an incredible work of art. Leonard Knight spent decades building this mountain in the middle of southern California. It was his calling in life to build one of the most unique monuments to God. [mn-post-ender]
