 1. Fish tacos from Calle Tacos 
    I had always HATED Mexican food until I hit up the West Coast. And I really mean hated but damn, these soft, crispy fish tacos with chipotle mayo are BOMB. Currently stuffing them in my face as the stereo blasts &#34;Ándale, morena!&#34; Check @calletacos out. They&#39;ve got both a restaurant and a truck. #la #losangeles #mexican #foodie #taco #fish #calletacos #chipotle #bbg #fitness #fittravel #wanderlust #travelstoke #travelblogger #foodie #foodporn #usa #mexico @brooklinebetches @matadornetwork #eeeeeats @eating_la A photo posted by Dayana Aleksandrova &#x1f1fa;&#x1f1f8;&#x1f1ea;&#x1f1f8;&#x1f1e7;&#x1f1ec; (@deeaxthesea) on Dec 11, 2015 at 6:04pm PST


Calle Tacos' location on Hollywood Boulevard beckons with its colorful and quirky design -- they have an actual food truck inside the restaurant -- and Ándale, morena and other Mexican jams are always blaring from the speakers. I used to hate Mexican food, but then I had a moment of truth here when I bit into the soft, fluffy tortilla of a crispy fish taco for the first time. My eyes widened, as though I had just taken whatever drug Lewis Carroll was on when he wrote Alice in Wonderland, and I surrendered to the flavor of fresh vegetables, sour cream and fried fish dancing in my mouth, so full, so juicy, so crunchy and crispy at the same time. You still haunt my dreams, Calle Tacos. 
 

 2. Spicy chicken at The Prince

When you enter The Prince, you might be stunned by the posh dining room. It's lavishly decorated with classical art on the walls and a grand piano on center stage -- and the place is just hidden in a tiny corner in Koreatown. I always order the spicy octopus with vegetables, the spicy chicken wings and a Corona to help me handle all the explosive flavor. Holy. Mother. Of. God. Each bite is fire. Perfectly tender, crispy and glazed with the perfect amount of sauce. I always leave the table sweating, heart pounding and determined to come back to LA just for those chicken wings at least one more time before I die.
 
 3. The Fairfax at Eggslut  
    Peek-a-boo, I&#39;m about to devour you! &#x1f60e; If you&#39;re only in LA for a day, bypass in-n-out and go to @eggslutla instead. I got the Fairfax and damn it, those eggs melted so delicately on my tongue, caramelized onions crunching, full of flavor, cheddar perfectly melted on each fluffy bite of egg...Can we do another round?&#x1f633;&#x1f373; @brooklinebetches #eggsluy #eeeeeats #losangeles #bbg #breakfast #goodmorning #brunch #fitness #fittravel #wanderlust #travelstoke #travelblogger #foodie #foodblogger #visitla #visitcalifornia #cannon #photography #photographer #eggsontheregs A photo posted by Dayana Aleksandrova &#x1f1fa;&#x1f1f8;&#x1f1ea;&#x1f1f8;&#x1f1e7;&#x1f1ec; (@deeaxthesea) on Dec 12, 2015 at 8:26am PST


I wanted to know what all the fuss was about, so I diligently waited for 20 minutes in the winding queue at Eggslut’s counter at Grand Central Market. I ordered the Fairfax with greens on the side. Let me put it this way: I thought no one in the world could beat my grandma’s fluffy eggs, until I met Eggslut. Sorry, Gram! The Fairfax is so brilliant in its simplicity - smooth, scrambled eggs, aromatic chives, melted Brie and the cherry on top -- caramelized onions.
 
 4. Drop Acid at Press Brothers 
    Warm yourself up with a little habanero kick! Drop Acid is a favorite among spice lovers and juice lovers alike. This juice is an excellent remedy to fighting that seasonal cold as well as a boost of energy to get you through the work day. Have a great Monday juicers! #dropacid #monday #habanero #pressbrothers #coldpressed #usdaorganic #juiceislife #dtla #raw #vegan #paleo #mydayinla photo by @deeaxthesea A photo posted by Press Brothers Juicery (@pressbrothers) on Dec 14, 2015 at 8:28am PST

 
Hugs, not drugs. But seriously, the Drop Acid juice will have you hooked in no time with its refreshing blend of cucumber, apple, arugula and lemon, and just as you think you can handle it -- boom! Here comes a kick of habanero pepper right into your nostrils, all the way into your throat. It’s hard to tell whether the Press Brothers are chefs, alchemists or bonafied artists.

 5. Hazelnut Burrata pizza at Pitfire 
    &#34;And on Saturday night they balled out.&#34; Evan &amp; I are both fitness fanatics (I mean, we wake up at 5am to work out every day) but we do splurge now and then. After a somewhat-shameful devouring of a few donuts in the car, we agreed on pizza. I was immediately sold by the &#34;burrata pie,&#34; a crispy pizza with tomato sauce, arugula, burrata cheese and here&#39;s the kicker - pesto + hazelnuts! &#x1f60b;&#x1f355; (he&#39;s having a plain old pepperoni, so do it my way ;) #pizza #saturday #la #losangeles #dtla #visitla #visitcalifornia #bbg #fitness #fittravel #wanderlust #foodie #foodporn A photo posted by Dayana Aleksandrova &#x1f1fa;&#x1f1f8;&#x1f1ea;&#x1f1f8;&#x1f1e7;&#x1f1ec; (@deeaxthesea) on Dec 12, 2015 at 8:08pm PST

 
I could’ve gone to a million pizzerias in my quest for doughy goodness, but a certain item on Pitfire’s menu had me really intrigued. The Burrata pie’s thin crust bears a ton of fresh arugula, tomato sauce, cheese and wait for it -- hazelnuts. “This could be amazing or a complete disaster,” I thought with a great deal of curiosity and anticipation. An unsuspected and surprisingly delicious combination between the full and creamy Burrata flavor and the crunchy texture of hazelnuts, this place is a must when a pizza craving strikes.

 6. Cake donuts at Philippe’s, the Original 
    Ever since I heard Phillipe&#39;s has secret donuts, I&#39;ve been wanting to try em. Sure enough, it&#39;s true! They come in 3 flavors and even tho they&#39;re cake donuts which are denser than yeast raised, I tried them all. The plain was the best, oddly enough. Tasty on it&#39;s own and perfectly dunkable into their 45 cent coffee. Glad I was able to make it in. #philippestheoriginal #philippes #secretdonut #eatinglosangeles #LA #LAndmarked #donuts #mmmDonuts #cakedonut #thisislosangeles #losangeles A photo posted by Emmanuel Cuetlatchli Lomeli (@eman_718) on Mar 16, 2015 at 6:45am PDT


If you, like me, bow down in obedience to your sweet tooth, you have to try Philippe’s cake donuts for breakfast. Round, plump and with no extra sugar, this tiny place in Chinatown is the sh*t. Knocking down a few cups of hot, 10-cent coffee, I indulged in 4 au natural, thick, no glaze, dough-y circle of joy for a total of less than $10. If you can’t wake up before 10:30 a.m, go for their French-dipped sandwiches; those are bomb, too. [mn-post-ender]
