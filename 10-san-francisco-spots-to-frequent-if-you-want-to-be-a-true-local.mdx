Locals don’t ride cable cars around San Francisco and spend their days at Fisherman’s Wharf looking at the sea lions. Actually, we only do those things when out--of--towners visit. Here are 10 places locals actually spend time, so if you want to experience true SF life, make these stops.

Mission and Valencia Streets

 Mission CheeseSan Francisco, United StatesThe Mission has the most street art of any neighborhood in the country. Enjoy walking between murals with burrito stops at La Taqueria, a beer and cheese flight break at Mission Cheese, thrift shopping on Mission Street, and perusing hip boutiques on Valencia Street. Check out how the Mexican influences have meshed with recent gentrification and watch out for resident hipsters on bikes flying down the street.

Bring some competitive friends along and make a day of it.

Treasure Island

 Treasure islandSan Francisco, United StatesStuck right between SF and the East Bay, Treasure Island isn’t a destination most tourists (or even locals!) visit. But it hosts great art festival monthly, and music festivals annually. There’s also a lot of room to bike and a few wineries that are worth a visit. Visit before all the spooky former government buildings are knocked down to make room for commercial development. Take a bus over from the Embarcadero or drive. There’s no ferry, yet.

 San Francisco Ferry BuildingSan Francisco, United StatesEach Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, some of SF’s best produce, cheese, bread, and seafood purveyors set up shop at the Ferry Building. Locals pick up weekly produce, and wait way-too-long in line for really good rotisserie chicken. Dining with a view of the Bay is expensive at neighboring restaurants, but cheap when you grab picnic supplies from local farms and walk out back.
