Now that tourism in the United States is bouncing back, luxury hotels are eager to partner with local businesses to give them a boost, too. Building on the farm-to-table trend on hotel restaurant menus and in guest-room minibars, you can now experience regional culture in even more ways. This might mean slipping into your very own locally designed bathrobe, or getting ready each morning with a cult-favorite brand of grooming products. Through these complimentary luxury hotel amenities, your time in the destination becomes even richer.

“By supporting small businesses, we support our friends and neighbors,” says Jonathan Morris, co-owner of Hotel Dryce in Fort Worth, Texas. “We can take control and play a genuine part in the economic development of our communities when we support our local businesses.” 

There are two other cool reasons these partnerships are innovative. If you have limited time in a destination, these products offer a wider glimpse into what makes a town or city tick. In some cases, it’s a small business or brand just getting its feet wet in the market, and as a guest, you’ll be among the first to try it out.

Hotel Dryce in Fort Worth, Texas

[gallery ids="701136,701135,701137,701134" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Because of his entrepreneurial roots, Morris had no question his hotel would support other independent businesses. He opened the 21-room Hotel Dryce in 2021. While the Lobby Bar hosts pop-ups by Dallas-area BIPOC artists, and there’s Cherry Coffee Shop’s coffee or Leaves Book and Tea Shop’s tea, Morris took it one step further.

Back in the room, guests can cozy up in a stylish burnt-orange robe by Morgan Mercantile, a Fort Worth apparel company exclusive to the hotel. 

“Using local products fits into our role as storytellers,” Morris says. “The most impactful way that we can tell the story of who we are is through the people, places and products that shape our lives day-in and day-out as Fort Worthians.”

A free little library or a lending library at a hotel isn’t necessarily new, but at each Study Hotel is a library specific to its academic surroundings. 

At The Study at the University of Chicago, this means classics and coffee-table books to books by the University of Chicago professors and alumni. This is a partnership with Seminary Co-op and available for guests to use during their stay.

Deer Path Inn in Lake Forest, Illinois
  
[gallery ids="701118,701119,701120" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Top-tier suites at the 55-room, English-style Deer Path Inn in a North Shore suburb of Chicago feature a full bar and “snack pantry,” with wines, spirits, mixers and snacks. What makes this bar different is everything is on the house -- and it is not filled with run-of-the-mill spirits. For instance, you can sip dry gin and whiskey from a nearby distillery.

“Since 1929, Deer Path Inn has served as a gathering place for our community and Chicagoans looking for an escape,” says Patrick Lacassagne, innkeeper. “We’ve married our English-inspired inn-keeping traditions with our commitment to supporting local businesses through our minibars, which feature a mix of English and European snacks along with dry gin and whiskey from nearby KOVAL Distillery.”
