HEY MATADORIANS: If you are in the LA area, we would love for you to join us next Friday for our first Los Angeles Matador Meetup in partnership with Hostelling International.  I am stoked to be leading a discussion on travel storytelling that draws upon my nearly five years of experience at Matador and also some of the core principles of MatadorU. Come for the workshop, stay for the BBQ, and join the HI crew and me to explore Santa Monica’s bar scene. 

Hope to see you there!
