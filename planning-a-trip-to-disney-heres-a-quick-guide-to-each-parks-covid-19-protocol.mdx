The happiest place on earth has made a few changes to its Disney magic since the start of the pandemic. At the start of the pandemic, all six parks around the world -- Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, FL, Disneyland Resort in California, Disneyland Paris, Shanghai Disney Resort, Hong Kong Disneyland, and Tokyo Disney Resort -- closed their park doors to prevent the virus' spread, but they've since opened with varying restrictions. Here are some reminders when planning your trip to one of these parks.

It's important to keep in mind that each park has different guidelines, and these rules may change rapidly. We will continue to update this post, but remember to always follow up with each park’s website for details.

All parks encourage guests to be vaccinated. Every park has sanitizing sections and have increased the frequency of cleaning. Additionally, parks have the right to escort anyone out if they don’t comply with COVID-19 protocols.
