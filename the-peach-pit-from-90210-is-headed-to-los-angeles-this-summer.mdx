After scrunchies and mom jeans, it’s the turn of another ‘90s icon to make its comeback. The Peach Pit, the ‘50s-style diner where Kelly, Brenda, Brendon, Steve, Dylan, Andrea, and David of the original series Beverly Hills, 90210 used to hang out after their classes at West Beverly High, is headed to Los Angeles this August.

The show is getting a reboot (BH90210) with its original cast on August 7, 2019, and to celebrate its revival, Fox and PopSugar are hosting the pop-up event on Melrose Avenue in LA between August 1 and August 3.

The Peach Pit After Dark will serve serve a maximum of two complimentary drinks on the first two days, and food and drinks will also be complimentary during the lunch openings on August 2 and August 3.

In a YouTube announcement ahead of the BH90210 launch, Jennie Garth said, “You and your friends are invited to come hang out at our favorite hangout, and have some diner food, some ‘90s nostalgia, and some fun photo ops.”
