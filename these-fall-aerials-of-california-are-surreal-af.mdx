Alexis Coram is a talented photographer who hit the pause button working in big tech and instead loaded her life -- and her pets -- into a camper van and hit the road. She's out there now, roaming for epic colors and dark skies and waterfalls. Lately, she's been experimenting with her drone, chasing after autumn tones from the sky. The results are pretty fantastic. Check out these moody, surreal aerials of fall in California as seen from above. [mn-post-ender]
