This portrait gallery was put together in collaboration with PATH LA, where men, women, and children living in homeless shelters across LA were given the opportunity to pose for the camera and tell the world what "home" means to them.

There are 60,000 homeless people in the city of Los Angeles. The city has worked tirelessly to maintain its glamorous and high-powered image, but this is belied by some of the highest rates of homelessness in the developed world. Instead, the celebrity image of Los Angeles that's exported all over the world has emboldened the homeless community to take it upon themselves to change the way they're perceived.

The perception of destitution and helplessness has been fought head-on by homeless shelters in order to bring humanity and dignity to people who've fallen through the cracks in our developed society. This collection is intended to highlight and dismantle a problem of perception we've attached to the homeless. This is what our homeless community looks like after a shower, hot meal, and a good night's sleep.
