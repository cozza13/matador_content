If you've always wanted to see the iconic, once-per-year, framed sunrise at Stonehenge, England, but have never managed to make it across the pond for the summer solstice, know that there may be a similar celestial event closer to home that you could attend: the sunset at La Jolla. 


  @visit Epic moment in in La Jolla&#x1f31e;, a seaside neighborhood within the city of San Diego, California, USA. Twice a year, the sunset aligns perfectly with the Scripps Pier, which tends to fall around early May and early-mid August! &#x1f1fa;&#x1f1f8;  &#34;This sunset alignment that only happens twice a year is a photographer’s dream. Here’s a time lapse view from the best seat in the house. Did you notice the green flashes at the top of the Sun?&#34; &#x2600;&#xfe0f; How awesome is this? &#x1f525; &#x1f4cd; La Jolla, San Diego, USA ig: @alexnyeart &#x1f3b6; M83 - Outro  ♬ original sound - Visit   

La Jolla is a seaside neighborhood of San Diego in California where you can catch a beautiful sunset over the ocean daily. But twice a year, once in May and once in August, the sunset is extra spectacular if you know where to go. Below Ellen Browning Scripps Memorial Pier, also know as Scripps Pier, the setting sun is perfectly framed by the pilings of the concrete structure, earning the event the nickname of Scrippshenge. Of course, this unusual sunset is dependent on the weather -- cloudy skies, although rare in this part of California, may ruin your view. 

Because this special La Jolla sunset is not a secret, arrive early and be ready to be fighting for a spot with many photographers. Everyone wants a shot of this rare event. 

Note that Scripps Pier is closed to the public, but walking under it from La Jolla Shores Beach is authorized and encouraged. La Jolla Shores Beach is a very popular spot for swimmers, surfers, and anyone who wants to enjoy the beauty of this mile-long sand beach. [mn-post-ender]
