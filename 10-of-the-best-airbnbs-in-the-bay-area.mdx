  It’s hard to get a feel for the area when you’re in a generic hotel or hostel room. It’s much better to spend your time in a local home. Many of the California Bay Area homes available on Airbnb are located in vineyards with terraces overlooking the vines, in bustling city districts or right on the Bay.  
 
Here are some of the best listings in the region.
