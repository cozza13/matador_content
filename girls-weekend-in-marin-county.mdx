

From Mill Valley to San Rafael, California's Marin County is the perfect weekend escape for friends looking to eat, drink, and relax. Take a weekend to explore the region -- with the convertible top down, of course -- through its elegant restaurants and wineries, happening nightlife, cozy independent hotels, cute towns, and natural coastal beauty. 

Sip sparkling wine (and other fermented thirst quenchers) at Heidrun Meadery. Tuck into a steak at Sammy Hagar and Tyler Florence's El Paseo. Catch live music at Sweetwater Music Hall. Marin's got your weekend covered.
