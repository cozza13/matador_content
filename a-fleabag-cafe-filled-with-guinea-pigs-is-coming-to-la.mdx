Fans of the show Fleabag might be sad about it coming to an end, but there’s one thing they can cling onto until they find a new show to love. A new pop-up guinea pig cafe inspired by the show has just opened in Los Angeles at 7924 Melrose Avenue. The pop-up, named Hilary’s Cafe, will be open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM until Friday, August 9 and will offer a complimentary drink and snack to customers from now until Friday.

The place is not only filled with pictures and statues of guinea pigs, but live guinea pigs as well. Guinea pig cages line the wall, with human handlers keeping watch over them to ensure their well-being. Visitors are encouraged to pet and hang out with the guinea pigs as much as they like, while feeding them treats.

If you haven’t seen the show and are totally in the dark, Fleabag is available on Amazon Prime, so you can catch up before checking out the cafe. [mn-post-ender]
