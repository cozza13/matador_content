While food trucks have been around since the days of the chuckwagon, their current renaissance arguably started in California and continues strong throughout the state. While we await the “threat” of taco trucks on every corner, here’s a few trucks of all stripes to check out.

Ricky’s Fish Tacos

 Ricky's Fish TacosLos Angeles, United StatesOne of the best fish tacos north of San Diego. Big portions, tasty sauces, super nice people working the truck. The shrimp taco is even better, and their agua frescas hit the spot on a boiling hot LA day. Sometimes they have specials that aren't posted on the truck, so check their Twitter or ask. 100% worth the hunt for parking.


Calle Tacos

 Calle TacosLos Angeles, United StatesLet me tell you, I used to hate tacos because I'd never had a good one, until this place. First time out to the west coast and Calle Tacos blew my mind. The fish taco is so fluffy, so crispy, so flavorful that you'll forget all your worries and beg for more. They've got a food truck (because who doesn't nowadays), as well as a Hollywood Blvd location. #cheap-eats #mexican

The Korean fusion truck, Kogi, was instrumental in starting the whole modern food truck thing and is still worth seeking out for its fusion tacos when in L.A. The new project from Roy Choi, founder of Kohi, is Locol. Its mission is to bring healthful food to underserved communities, and they’ve opened brick and mortar places in both NorCal and SoCal. Only SoCal so far is blessed with the truck!
