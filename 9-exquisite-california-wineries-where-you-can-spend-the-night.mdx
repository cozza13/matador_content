California has more wineries than any other state -- about five times as many as the runner-up, Oregon, which together account for 85 percent of all the wine made in the US. Given the sheer amount of wine that's produced in California, planning a day trip to one of the state's many wine regions simply isn't enough; you need to stay longer. You could book a hotel in Napa, Sonoma, Paso Robles, or another grape-growing destination, but why leave the vineyards at all? There are quite a few California wineries with lodging that let you sleep right where the magic is made. Here are nine of the dreamiest wine estates that you can call home for the night.

Sirena Vineyard Resort, Paso Robles
[gallery ids="732100,732101" size="full" type="slider"  /]

At a glance, Sirena’s all-white, adobe-style winery looks like something you might see crowning a vineyard in Greece. It’s actually located in the Santa Lucia Mountains a few minutes from downtown Paso Robles in Central California. Among the vines, there’s a restored mansion with just seven bedrooms, as well as a handful of villas ringing an infinity pool. The in-room water features are equally luxurious; past guests have raved about the rain showers and Roman tubs. Breakfast is included at Sirena — although guests also have access to a fully equipped kitchen — and massages can be booked on request. Rooms start at $247 per night.

Poetry Inn, Napa
Napa’s Poetry Inn belongs to the Cliff Lede Winery in the valley’s historic Stags Leap District. The winery operates multiple vineyards from Calistoga to Carneros, but the inn sits on the Poetry Vineyard that’s located along Napa’s famous Silverado Trail. The name comes from a Robert Louis Stevenson quote comparing wine to bottled poetry.

Just outside the town of Yountville, the inn has five beautifully appointed suites. The largest suite, the Robert Louis Stevenson suite, spans 1,450 square feet and comes with a private entrance and wraparound deck. The smallest suite, the Emily Dickinson Suite, is still bigger than many studio apartments at 970 square feet and comes with a private terrace. Spa treatments and private dining are available on request, along with a personalized concierge service to help you plan your ideal Napa getaway. Suites are upwards of $2,000 per night.

Lynmar Estate, Sebastopol
Forty years ago, Lynmar Estate operated a single vineyard in the Russian River Valley of Sonoma County. Now, the winery manages four vineyards that span dozens of acres just 12 miles inland of the Pacific Ocean — the perfect environment for chardonnay and pinot noir grapes. It also manages a three-bedroom accommodation called the Bliss House, which boasts views of the original Quail Hill Vineyard and the Laguna de Santa Rosa wetlands. Although guests have access to a fully equipped kitchen, Lynmar Estate also employs a crack culinary team that creates menus to pair perfectly with the winery’s vintages and varietals, sourcing as many ingredients as possible from the kitchen gardens. Bliss House has a two-night minimum, with prices from $750 to $1,500 for different levels of membership.

The Salvestrin family has been producing wine in Napa Valley since 1932.

If you’re not ready to leave after one of the tasting experiences, you can book a stay at the 1879 Victorian Inn at Salvestrin, a stone’s throw from downtown St. Helena.

Carter Estate Winery and Resort, Temecula
[gallery ids="732110,732111,732112" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Carter Estate is a mid-sized winery and resort in Temecula Valley with 42 Mediterranean-inspired bungalows suites located on 112 acres of vineyards. What makes the tasting experiences so special is the estate’s focus on sparkling wine that’s produced using the same Méthode Champenoise that’s used to produce Champagne in France — in fact, it claims to be the only winery in the Temecula Valley to use the method. Olive oil tastings are also on offer. Visitors who choose to stay the night are guaranteed perks such as a private patio and complimentary continental breakfast. For the rest of your meals, there’s an on-site grill that serves bistro-style fare both in-room and poolside. Rooms start at $249 per night.

Freeman Vineyard and Winery, Sebastopol
Like many Sonoma Coast wineries, Freeman specializes in pinot noir and chardonnay. The total yearly production is limited to 5,000 cases to ensure the quality of every bottle, and the on-site accommodation shares the same attention to detail. There’s a single guesthouse located on the property between the Gloria Estate Vineyard and the surrounding redwoods. It has three bedrooms and three baths, perfect for a small-group retreat. The only catch is that you have to become part of the Friends of Freeman wine club to book. Private tastings cost $40 per person, and prospective guests can inquire about rates for a three-night minimum stay at the cottage.

Allegretto Vineyard Resort, Paso Robles
[gallery ids="732115,732116,732117,732118" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Of all the California wineries with lodging on this list, Allegretto is the largest vineyard resort with 171 rooms and suites. But worry not that its size sacrifices its luxury. The property is laid out like a museum, with sculptures reminiscent of European antiquities scattered throughout the grounds, a Moroccan-style central plaza, and a motion-activated “sonic labyrinth” outdoors.

In addition to wine tastings, Allegretto hosts activities such as art tours and yoga classes. After taking advantage of the on-site pool and spa, lounging in garden swings imported from India, or visiting the vineyard’s resident alpaca, guests can settle in for dinner at the Cello Ristorante &amp; Bar followed by a private firepit session. The animal-friendly property also welcomes dogs — complete with a meal service designed just for them. Rooms start at $249 per night. [mn-post-ender]
