Tartine Bakery

 Tartine BakerySan Francisco, United StatesThe best French bakery in the Mission, Tartine is famous for its scrumptious pastries. My favorites (because I can't choose just one) the quiche and the bread pudding (pictured here). If you come on the weekend, get ready to wait in line for about an hour. It's worth it.
