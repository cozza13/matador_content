Upon the arrival of November is the yearly return of the Leonids meteor shower, where astronomy enthusiasts can get epic views of meteors streaking across the sky. From Thursday, November 3, through Friday, December 2 and peaking on November 18, viewers can expect to see about 15 bright meteors per hour, traveling at 44 miles per second. To get a good view of this yearly phenomenon, you'll need to get away from the light pollution to get some incredible sights of the stars. Carneros Resort and Spa in Napa Valley has the perfect viewing spot for anyone wanting to make a weekend trip of it. 

This 28-acre luxury resort offers the perfect unique getaway to catch a glimpse of the colorful glimmering meteors. Guests can stay in one of the resort's cottages with private backyards, cozy fire pits, outdoor soaking tubs, and of course, on-demand wine dispensers in the spirit of wine country. Guests who book the Cozy Cottage Nights package will receive a fireside s'mores kit and telescope to enjoy unobstructed sky views. If you want to improve the experience, the resort will hire expert astronomers for a private on-site experience with local stargazing company Wine Country Star Party.
