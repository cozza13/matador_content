Cataract Falls

Tennessee Valley Trailhead
Mill Valley, United States
Just north of the Golden Gate Bridge is a short and flat 1.7 mile trail to Tennessee Valley Beach. Great for families. For a more rigorous trail you can venture off one of the other trails that lead up in the hills. #hiking #beach #marin #california





2. Have a Mission burrito.

While there’s wide disagreement about who's the best, make sure to have at least one, any one. Or try more and wade into the unresolvable “best burrito” debate.
 




La Taqueria
San Francisco, United States
I just did terrible things to a carnitas burrito.









Gordo Taqueria

Taqueria Vallarta

Top three tacos in SF. Lot's of competition, but this has been thoroughly vetted. Open till 3am. #cheap-eats #open-late





3. Summit one of San Francisco's many hills and ridges to get your bearings.

San Francisco's Presidio is an amazing place for a walk or run. Check out the trail on the ridge above the golf course for great views of both the Bay & the Ocean. Oh, and an Andy Goldsworthy sculpture. #hiking




 
4. Try a cuisine you've never had before.

SF’s long history as a crossroads and melting pot leads to a huge list of cuisines. The Tenderloin is an especially great neighborhood for small and unusual eateries.

6. Get out on the Bay.

The Bay Area is all about, well, the bay. The longer you’re here, the more you’ll see how much the bay itself changes with the light and seasons. Get out on the water for a broader perspective -- whether it’s a trip to Alcatraz (make sure to make reservations ahead of time) or a ferry ride across the bay (easy to do spontaneously), make sure to get out on the water.

Coit Tower
San Francisco, United States
Coit Tower, also known as the Lillian Coit Memorial Tower, is a 210-foot (64 m) tower in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The tower, in the city's Pioneer Park, was built in 1933 using Lillie Hitchcock Coit's bequest to beautify the city of San Francisco; at her death in 1929 Coit left one-third of her estate to the city for civic beautification. #history





For more contemporary murals, head to the Mission District, where art tells the story of the neighborhood that persists beneath the recent changes.

This place is mind blowing and we are so lucky to have it here in the Bay Area. So many things to do and so many things to learn about the world. It's great even for small kids because everything is hands on.
