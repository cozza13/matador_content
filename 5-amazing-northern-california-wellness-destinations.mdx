Northern California’s landscape provides a stunning backdrop for travelers searching for the ultimate health trifecta of mental, physical, and emotional recharge. Its acres of redwoods, endless miles of coastline, and rugged mountain peaks can create a spaciousness in the mind, an openness that allows visitors to take a deep breath and escape from daily life.
 
Until fairly recently, wellness travel emphasized starvation-style boot camps or expensive spa weekends to detox from unhealthy habits. According to the Global Wellness Institute, wellness travel is one of the fastest-growing segments of tourism. It is expected to grow to $919 billion by 2022 and now reflects a myriad of healing practices.
 
Wellness tourism can be all-season hygge, or simplicity, like watching birds at sunset, picking your own fresh produce to enjoy for lunch, melting into a simple massage, indulging in local haute cuisine, or hiking through the woods. The ambiance can vary from rustic to elegant, with prices just as varied. NorCal is definitely one of the best places to discover what helps you relax and unwind.
 
These healing destinations promote self-exploration and revitalization. You can choose to take a simple weekend getaway or plan a longer excursion. All five properties are in sanctuaries of nature, creating the ideal place to cleanse and restore the spirit, anytime, or at least try to. Here are some of the best wellness destinations in Northern California. 
 
1. Allegretto Vineyard Resort, Paso Robles

The sprawling Allegretto Vineyard Resort is like a slice of Tuscany. It is set among 20 acres of vineyards, olive trees, and fruit-bearing orchards, and is five miles from Paso Robles’ downtown hub of activity. The owner, a visionary who practices Eastern philosophy, meditation, and yoga, spent years creating a harmonized refuge, based on the spirituality he studied around the globe. The Italian-themed architecture beautifully complements the quiet walking paths, fountains, and cozy sitting areas tucked inside manicured gardens. You can enjoy a personal afternoon at the spa, pool, and cabanas, or immerse yourself in a guided distillery tour and mixology class. The Cello Ristorante & Bar emphasizes locally farmed and foraged cuisine like the risotto del giorno (risotto of the day), which varies based on the availability of regional produce. The world’s first Sonic Labyrinth is here too. As you walk along a circling stone path off the side of the resort, cascading sounds wash over you, creating the sense of a sound bath for the soul.

Guests can fill their days with guided nature walks, take a swim in one of three pools, unwind in the world-class spa, take archery lessons with a private instructor, or scramble up an outdoor climbing wall. In the evening an experienced “dark sky” guide leads a nighttime hike. The lodge is also a short drive from the Mariposa Grove trail, home to 500 giant sequoia trees, some of Earth’s largest living organisms.

Vacaville is approximately 55 miles northeast of San Francisco and is known for alpaca farming and agriculture. This meditation and retreat center is also a nonprofit organization, situated on a quiet mountaintop that encompasses 25 acres of farmland. The ground is rich with honey, peaches, lavender, and apricots, and is surrounded by several hundred acres of additional land. When you enter, you must take a vow of silence. In this personal and collective quiet, you can walk, read, journal, garden, or swim in your free time. Twice a day you’re encouraged to join the center’s unique “heartfulness” meditation, which combines modern psychology with Christian and Eastern mystical practices.
