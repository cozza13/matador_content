Coachella and Stagecoach have come and gone, but if you're daydreaming about returning to sunny California for another epic festival, The All Day I Dream Festival plans to fully immerse you in another world using art, music, food, wellness, and a community of dreamers. 

The All Day I Dream Festival is hosting its inaugural three-day event from May 12 to May 15 on 82 acres of land at Woodward Park & Lake. This music festival is for people 21 and older except for children 12 and under. Festival-goers can expect to enjoy four sound stages, camping areas with specific amenities, yoga and health and wellness activities, gourmet food vendors and bars, a vendor village, art cars, and art installations all around the grounds.

Attendees are encouraged to be self-sufficient and are welcome to set up camp and create tiny communities on the large stretch of land. Guests can enjoy art installations like HOLOREALMʓ, created by Öona Dahl and Julia Sinelnikova, also known as ORACLE666. HOLOREALMʓ is an audiovisual experience that uses music, sculpture, lighting, and performance art to create a fully immersive experience. Think of it like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole to Wonderland. Other art installations include the Forest of Dreams, the Polymorphic Duo, and the Dream Vortex. The festival also promises unique cuisine and a Wellness Sanctuary, where guests can enjoy yoga, sound healing, meditation, and other activities. 

EDM music lovers will be excited about the lineup. Festival headliners include Little Dragon and RY X, and it features other artists like Cubicolor, Guy Gerber, Lee Burridge, Poolside, Yokoo, and more, beginning at 2 PM on Thursday. To get to the music festival, attendees can fly into Stockton, San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, Concord, or Sacramento airport. The festival is about a 1.5-hour drive from San Francisco and a five-hour drive from Los Angeles. Once festival goers reach the massive park (ticket-holders will also need a car or RV pass for entry), it's a windy road to get inside, so drive safe.

Although glamping tickets are sold out, you can still purchase one, two, and four-day passes with the necessary car or RV pass. Tickets start at $100 for those 21-and-over, and $20 for children 12 and younger. Get ready for an experience you'll never forget. [mn-post-ender]
