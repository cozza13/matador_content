At the top of the list of fictional restaurants that bring an onset of millennial nostalgia, Good Burger, home of the Good Burger, sits at the top. Now, people can get a taste thanks to a pop-up Good Burger restaurant that’s opening in Los Angeles on July 10.

The timing coincides with a Nickelodeon remake of All That (because what is a good ‘90s cultural touch point without a 2010s reboot?), and the team behind it is the same one that designed the Saved By the Max pop-up from Saved By the Bell. Good Burger comes from an All That sketch featuring Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell that was turned into a 1997 movie, Good Burger. Both center around the shenanigans of Dexter and Ed, two fast-food workers who interact with customers and try and keep the nearby rival Mondo Burger from taking over. The All That sketches and movie were part of what launched the career of Thompson, who is now on Saturday Night Live.

The All That reboot is being produced by Thompson and Mitchell, and premieres on June 15 with original cast members and the Jonas Brothers joining in. Mitchell teased the pop-up with a YouTube video promising good burgers, good chunks, and good shakes. A Nickelodeon statement given to Entertainment Weekly adds that anyone who makes it to the pop-up will get “Good Burger-themed service experiences, merchandise, games, secret sauce, and more.”

Pop-ups are crowded, and nostalgia and Instagram driven ones are even more so. Get your tickets early on the pop-up’s website starting June 17 at 10:00 AM PST to get a taste. [mn-post-ender]
