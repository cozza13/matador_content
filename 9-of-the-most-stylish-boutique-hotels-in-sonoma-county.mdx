1. The Stavrand

[gallery ids="677138,677137,677139" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Open since September, this 21-room property in Guerneville splits its rooms among three Spanish Mission-style buildings flaunting creamy-white stucco and indigo paint trim. One was designed by Carl Warnecke, John F. Kennedy’s personal architect, and dates back to 1922. Although the coastline is just a 20-minute drive further west, you may not wish to leave once you take a dip in the pool or dine at its all-day restaurant, where former chefs of Healdsburg’s highly acclaimed Chalkboard plate photo-worthy cuisine, from breakfast bowls to pork chops with grilled peaches. Items are often culled from the on-site orchard and garden. A nightly wine reception is included with all rates and fireside s’mores crackle into the night.

The Farmhouse Inn is one of the best hotels in Sonoma County. This modern twist on a vintage farmhouse in Forestville tucks in lots of luxuries for guests, like a spa and a Michelin-star chef. 

Each of the 25 rooms flaunts farmhouse-chic décor such as ship-lap walls, four-poster beds and white sofa slipcovers. Nightly wine tastings ensure you’re plugged into popular Sonoma County wines. Fireplaces, fresh-cut floral bouquets and Sonoma-made toiletries in each room make the place feel cozy even during winter. This luxury extends to the baths, decked out with either a sauna, steam shower or jetted tub. Dubbed “The Wellness Barn,” this spa provides not only massage treatments but also sound-bath meditations and workshops teaching how to make body products or herbal teas.

3. El Dorado Hotel

[gallery ids="675894,675893,675892,675891" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Shouldered by winery tasting rooms, art galleries and boutiques on Sonoma’s plaza is this 27-room hotel, within an 1843 landmark building once home to the brother of Sonoma Valley founder General Mariano Vallejo. 

Despite its in-town setting, there’s a saltwater pool on the property and the courtyard is anchored by a 150-year-old fig tree. With balconies, French doors and illy espresso machines, the rooms are great places to hang but if you feel a little wanderlust can hop on a complimentary bike with an adorable basket (to hold any wine purchases). Locals love to sit down at the farm-to-table El Dorado Kitchen, with dining spaces on the patio or inside and a menu orchestrated by Le Bernardin alum Armando Navarro.

4. Boon Hotel and Spa

[gallery ids="675887,675888,675889,675890" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Each of the 18 guest rooms at this Guerneville hotel owned by local chef Christa Luedke commit to preserving the earth, like cork floors, organic-cotton bed linens and reclaimed-teak shower mats. 

With malm fireplaces, they’re also Scandi-inspired. For a more rugged -- but no less refined -- accommodation there’s a glamping tent or a refurbished vintage camper. Both the pool and lawn games are fun throwback activities. Scones and French-press coffee delivered to the room means you can linger even longer each morning. If more rest and relaxation is needed, book a massage -- choose from an indoor or open-air setting. And if you are feeling adventurous, bright-orange loaner bicycles allow you to explore beyond the property.

5. Wildhaven

[gallery ids="675910,675911,675912" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Wildhaven sits on a 10-acre property along the Russian River. The property caters to campers and outdoor lovers who want a little pampering. 

Each of the 40 glamping tents has outlets to charge your phone and either one or two queen-size memory-foam mattresses that are, thankfully, not on the floor but in snazzy bed frames instead. You also don’t have to give up hot showers: simply walk over to the modern shower building. Participating in yoga classes or listening to live music are two of the ways you can get to know other guests. While there’s no restaurant, a communal outdoor kitchen and your very own fire pit make grilling a breeze. S’mores kits and bottles of wines round out this upscale outdoor-sleeping experience.

7. Timber Cove Resort

[gallery ids="675908,675906,675907,675909" size="full" type="slider"  /]

If you really want to get away from wine country -- and move closer to the waves, from a perch just above -- this 46-room retreat on 25 acres of Pacific Ocean coastline in Jenner is your utopia. 

One of the best hotels in Sonoma Country, the 1963 resort reopened in 2016 with a completely new look. All interiors were designed by The Novogratz, a widely known Los Angeles design firm with a young, artsy couple at the helm who also sell a furnishings line through Target. Each guest room boasts a Crosby record player, a mini bar stuffed with Sonoma-made snacks, and a yoga mat. There’s something for everyone on the property, including three miles of hiking trails as well as “wine down” evenings on Tuesday and Thursday where local-winery pours are the focus. Coast Kitchen’s all-day, localized menu is served in the dining room, near an outdoor fire pit, in the lobby bar, or overlooking the ocean from an outdoor patio. An artist-in-residence provides the tunes every Wednesday night.

8. Hotel E

[gallery ids="675905,675903,675904" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Within Sonoma County’s most populated city of Santa Rosa, the 71-room Hotel E is on Old Courthouse Square. 

A rooftop lodge and restored Beaux-Arts architecture are serious eye candy. Black-and-white framed photos of the area as well as original art are in each guest room. For a glass of wine, head to the rooftop lounge or the lively Enology Lounge in the lobby. Locals will recognize Perry’s Santa Rosa, an offshoot of the famed San Francisco restaurant’s three locations and serving steaks, burgers, cobb salads and additional diner fare. Note that the rooftop lounge plans to reopen in 2022 along with a revamped outdoor courtyard.

9. Rock House Suites

[gallery ids="676264,676265,676260,676266" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Perfect if you can’t decide between an Airbnb and a boutique hotel, or you need to book two suites, these accommodations in downtown Healdsburg, near the town’s plaza, are affiliated with Wilson Artisan Wines. 

Aptly named The Cloud Suite and The Garden Suite, each is newly renovated with ship-lap walls and a kitchenette. Either suite offers space to spread out with outdoor spaces you can access -- a rose-filled courtyard with a fire pit in one or a quaint patio in another. Or, you can get cozy back at the room, thanks to fireplaces and spa-like baths after the tasting rooms close for the night. Many are even within a few blocks’ radius so you can ditch the car for a rather unique tour of Sonoma County wineries. [mn-post-ender]
