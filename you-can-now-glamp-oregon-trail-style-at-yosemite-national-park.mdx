Glamping is the perfect activity for those who enjoy time outdoors and reveling in the thrill of nature, but aren’t quite outdoor-sy enough to really rough it by ccamping in a tent. If you prefer a soft mattress, heating, and a place to plug in your phone for the night without carrying a portable charger, Yosemite National Park has the perfect spot. As of Labor Day Weekend, you can now explore Yosemite Valley or make your way up the famed Half Dome and then spend the night in rugged comfort, Oregon Trail-style.

Yosemite Pines RV Resort and Family Lodging, just west of the park, opened a collection of Conestoga wagons onsite for those looking to avoid throwing up a tent after a day exploring the high country, as reported by Afar. Some wagons sleep four while others sleep six, but all are equipped with the basic necessities to make your stay comfortable. Refrigerators and microwaves are standard, and there’s even a coffee pot in each wagon. You’ll be cozy, warm, and protected from mosquitos and other bugs, all while still technically sleeping outdoors to the comforting sounds of nature.

Each wagon has a communal fire pit and picnic table for evening jam sessions and morning breakfast prep. The wagons don’t have restroom facilities, but don’t fret -- showers and toilets are located just a short walk away, though you’ll need to bring your own towel. The resort sits just outside the park’s boundary, about 25 minutes east of the town of Moccasin. The wagons are available to book year-round and cost between $139 and $179 per night. If you’re heading there soon and can book by September 30th, use the code WAGONINTRO at checkout for a limited-time offer that gives you a second night free. [mn-post-ender]
