Lake Tahoe is one of the most desirable vacation destinations in the US, and it’s no surprise why. The huge freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada Mountains between California and Nevada is known both nationally and internationally for its beaches, ski resorts, state park, and hiking trails. Airbnbs in Tahoe might have usurped the popularity of traditional hotels recently, but it is also home to dozens of great hotels bursting with character. For the best way to experience the largest alpine lake in North America, check out one of these Lake Tahoe hotels.
