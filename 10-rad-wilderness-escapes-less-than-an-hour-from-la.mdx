

MOST OUTSIDERS seem to associate Los Angeles with traffic and sprawl and the TV / film industry. But when you really dig in here you realize right away that America's 2nd biggest city is actually in an unbelievably beautiful natural setting with world-class surf spots, mountains, and desert terrain all within striking distance.

From dramatic coastlines and beach parks to the banks of the much-maligned LA river, here are the urban escapes into nature that keep my soul alive here.

And lastly, these spots are all taken directly from my travelstoke®, a new app from Matador that connects you with fellow travelers and locals; it allows you to walk into a city and instantly have friends there, to build your global network of friends, and to even have more fun connecting with new people in your home city. Download the app to add any of the spots below directly to your future trips. 

Now grab your sunscreen, we’re going outside. [mn-post-ender]

Terranea Cove Beach



    

    Terranea Cove Beach
    Rancho Palos Verdes, United States
    This tiny cove is surrounded by sea cliffs and although it is within the Terrranea Resort grounds it is assessible to the public as are all of the nature trails and beaches on the resort. Look for migrating grey whales in the spring. #beach #resort






Bowtie Project



    

    Bowtie Project
    Los Angeles, United States
    A nearly empty piece of public land used by an artist collective for sculptural works and live performances. One of the very few places you can actually camp in LA (although I can't recommend it.) - this is a cool stop on a bike ride around the LA River and certainly the most post-apocalyptic state park your likely to find. #losangeles #park





Zuma Beach



    

    Zuma Beach
    Malibu, United States
    Leave LA behind and drive south up the PCH and pull off at Zuma Beach - a local favorite for chilling out on the sand and surfing. Adopt the local attitude and plan on spending the day in the waves and under the sun. #beach #surfing #malibu





Dockweiler State Beach



    

    Dockweiler State Beach
    Los Angeles, United States
    One of the only places you can have a bon fire on the beach around LA. The Dockweiler fire pits are awesome but suuuuper popular, especially on the weekends in the summer months. Bring plenty of fire wood and friends and pass the night telling spoony stories! Nearby rv camping can be found as well. #losangeles #camping






El Matador State Beach



    

    El Matador State Beach
    Malibu, United States
    A few miles north of Malibu is a magical beach named El Matador. It is lined with sea facing cliffs and riddled with huge rock structures that rise from the sand and surf. The little tunnels and caves are crowd favorites. Warning: this place is very popular with film, commercial and photo shoots...which can really kill the vibe... #beach #malibu






Wisdom Tree



    

    Wisdom Tree
    Los Angeles, United States
    A secret LA pilgrimage, the hike to the Tree of Life is a perfect way to bring in the sunset. A solitary tree on a ridgeline near the Hollywood sign, the Tree of Life is surrounded by rock art and good vibes. A personal fave. #losangeles #hike





Amir's Garden



    

    Amir's Garden
    Los Angeles, United States
    This place is an oasis within an oasis. A renegade garden created and tended over years in Griffith Park, Amir's Garden is an amazing place to chill after a hike or ride. If you find it, be glad. #park #losangeles #hiking





Topanga State Park



    

    Topanga State Park
    Topanga, United States
    Topanga is an enormous park that staddles the Santa Monica Mountains and is criss crossed with trails for hiking and biking. In the Spring it is a glory of green just minutes from LA. There is a small camp ground as well.  #biking  #hiking #camping





Los Angeles River Bicycle Path



    

    Los Angeles River Bicycle Path
    Long Beach, United States
    One of my favorite places to bike in LA, the Los Angeles River bike path follows a beautiful 7 mile stretch of the LA River known as the Glendale narrows. You can always spot lots of wildlife such as ducks, cranes, turtles and from the comfort and safety of a dedicated bike lane. In a busy city known to be unfriendly to cyclists - this bike path is a relaxing respite from the risks of city riding. #bike #park #bicycle





Inspiration Point Tide Pools



    

    Inspiration point tide pools
    Rancho Palos Verdes, United States
    Check the tide charts and explore at low tide, searching the colorful tide pools for sea stars, anemones, fish, crabs and all sorts of ocean critters. An amazing place to picnic and take photos while you explore the coast. You'll probably have the place to yourself. #beach #ranchopalosverdes
