As part of California’s new measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, the state is urging residents to stay home as much as possible, and asking those from other states to kindly stay away. Updated guidance from the California Department of Public Health takes these advisories one step further, telling Californians not to travel more than 120 miles from their residence except for essential reasons.

Essential trips are defined as those “associated with the operation, maintenance, or usage of critical infrastructure or otherwise required or expressly authorized by law … including work and study, critical infrastructure support, economic services and supply chains, health, immediate medical care and safety and security.”

Nonessential travel, chiefly applying to recreation or tourism, is strongly discouraged.

California is one of the states hit hardest by the pandemic, with cases reaching 2.5 million this week. Since anyone visiting from another state or country -- or even a Californian traveling throughout the state -- increases the risk of the virus’ transmission, the government is doing whatever it can to keep people at home. Quarantining for 10 days after crossing the border is strongly encouraged, except in cases of essential travel.

According to LA County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer, residents “should keep in mind that community transmission rates are so high that you run the risk of an exposure whenever you leave your home. It’s better to be home than sick.” [mn-post-ender]
