Morning
If you haven't Airbnb-ed a place in some other district and find yourself near Fisherman’s Wharf, the first tip is to get out of there. Union Square is still touristy, but it’s worth seeing and good for a stroll. Honey Honey is a solid breakfast spot.

Hopefully you’ve had enough sense to come to the city when the crowds are sparse, but can still appreciate some decent weather; October is a good middle ground. The reason why will become apparent as you walk down to Powell Street Station and check out the line waiting for the cable cars; during the summer, it’s not unusual to wait a couple hours to ride.

There are actually three different routes for cable cars around the city, but the most popular one runs between Powell and Hyde Streets, all the way to Ghirardelli Square, home of Ghirardelli Chocolates; grab a cup of hot chocolate and help yourself to some free samples. You’ll need the energy for what’s to come.

Rent a bike. Prices vary. Blazing Saddles is a popular choice, but Park Wide, though more expensive, offers pickups at nearby Fort Mason and drop offs at the Ferry Building. Enjoy the fair weather and wind along the water as you cycle over the Golden Gate Bridge - give yourself enough time for pictures! - and into Sausalito.
Noonish
If you’re in decent shape, it will only take about an hour to cycle from Fort Mason into Sausalito, maybe two if you give yourself enough time to appreciate the views at the bridge and vista point. Sausalito Taco Shop is a solid choice for a budget lunch, but there are plenty of other places within walking distance: Napa Valley Burger Company. Enjoy the view of the bay and check out galleries like The Art of Dr. Seuss to pass the time until the next ferry.
Afternoon
The ferry from Sausalito back to San Francisco ($6.25 with a Clipper Card) only takes 30 minutes but offers amazing views of the Golden Gate Bridge, the city itself, and a closer look at Alcatraz (better than waiting for one of those tours). You’ll get dropped at the Ferry Building - naturally - where you can peruse local shops for wine and fine foodstuffs if you need to bring back gifts. Some days there’s a farmer’s market right on the Embarcadero.

Once you’ve returned your bike rental, hop on board one of the F trains for $2.25. Although part of San Francisco’s Muni system, all of the cars running on this line have been reclaimed from old street car systems across the globe, including Milan and Philadelphia. Stay on this train all the way to the end of the line, carrying you through the Financial District and Market Street until you see a huge rainbow flag: your entrance to the Castro.

Immediately after you exit the car, you might be hungry and thirsty. Fortunately, Hot Cookie, with its erotic macaroons and delicious baked goods, is right across the street. Wash that down with a Philz Coffee after a short walk window shopping.

Take some time to appreciate the architecture all around you. Some of the houses here survived the great fire of 1906, like the Caselli Mansion. You may not have time to see the Painted Ladies near Alamo Square, but properties in the Castro are well maintained and visually stunning

Assuming it’s a Sunday - even if it’s not, it’s still a good plan - you should walk over to Dolores Park and enjoy some of the craziness that only San Francisco can offer: dancing robots, acro yoga, and of course one of the friendly ladies openly selling pot brownies. Hopefully, you’ve had time to grab a six-pack of some of the city’s local brews: 21st Amendment and Anchor Steam are close by, with Lagunitas based in Sonoma County.
Night
By the time you’ve danced and drunk to your heart’s content, the sun may have already disappeared behind Twin Peaks and left you shivering; in this city, save October, warm nights are mysteriously absent despite a scorching day. Now you’re close enough to the Mission District to appreciate some genuine Californian Mexican food: I’m partial to the fajita burritos at Little Chihuahua, but El Faro and Taqueria Cancun are solid choices as well.

To wrap up the evening, you’ve got the whole world at your feet:

Maybe you’re in the mood for a romantic view with a loved one? Grab an Uber to the top of Twin Peaks for a truly peaceful look at the city sparkling under the moonlight.

Maybe you need something sweet? Tartine Bakery and Bi-Rite are close by and offer some excellent pastries.

Maybe you still need to experience some San Francisco wacky fun? See if you can spot a naked person walking down the street. Or just stand outside the 16th St BART Station and listen to a street band.
