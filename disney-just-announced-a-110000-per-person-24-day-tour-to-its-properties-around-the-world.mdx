There are plenty of people across the globe who are obsessed with Disney, and I would consider myself pretty close. I don't go as far as collecting ears or joining Disney Facebook groups, but when I went to college about 20 minutes from the park, you could find me using my pass every Friday and sometimes multiple times a week. Disney's latest Adventures by Disney package is for the ultimate Disney fan, but it's going to cost you -- and I mean really cost you. 

Disney Parks Around The World – A Private Jet Adventure is a 24-day trip covering six countries and all 12 Disney theme parks, plus wonders like the Taj Mahal, the Pyramids of Giza, and the Eiffel Tower. Guest will be trotted around in a VIP-configured private Boeing 757 operated by Icelandair. Guests will also have access to Disney experts and staff, a personal chef and a physician to get the inside scoop and fun facts about Disney. Accommodations are top tier, with stays at Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa, the Summit Skywalker Ranch, Tokyo Disneyland Hotel, Disney's Hotel New York – The Art of Marvel, Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, the Shanghai Disneyland Hotel, and more. 

While this might sound like the itinerary of your dreams, the cost is pretty appalling. Get ready to shell out $109,995, not to mention if you want to claim your spot at that price point, you'll need to book for at least two people (yes, that is the price for one person). Otherwise, you'll have to tack on a $10,995 single occupant fee. While entry to 31 sites, 68 meals, a private jet, and VIP accommodations might be worth that much in theory, I can think of a million other things I'd be willing to spend $110,000 on. There are only 75 spots available, and if the high cost of some of Disney's other experiences are any indication, they will probably be filled regardless of the price. Tickets will be available in stages, with previous Adventures by Disney guests getting first dibs before it opens up to Golden Oak Members, and then the general public. The trip starts on July 9, 2023, and ends on August 1, 2023. 

So if you're a Disney fan with $110,000-plus burning a hole in your pocket, I guess you know where to put all that cash. [mn-post-ender]
