Pfeiffer Falls Trail in Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park will be reopening on June 18 for the first time in 13 years. The fully renovated trail is reopening to the public after the Basin Complex Fire destroyed the trail back in June 2008. 

In 2008 the Basin Complex Fire destroyed over 162,818 acres of Big Sur. The blaze destroyed much of the Pfeiffer Falls Trail’s infrastructure, including bridges, railings, steps, signs, and walls.  

“We’re thrilled to announce the reopening of the Pfeiffer Falls Trail,” said Jim Doran, program manager of Monterey District Roads, and Trails, California State Parks. “Before the 2008 Basin Complex Fire, this was one of the most popular trails in Big Sur -- a destination for California tourists. With the trail’s many improvements completed, we’re happy to welcome visitors once again.”

The renovations cost nearly $2 million to complete, including funding, grants, and donations from California Natural Resources Agency’s California River Parkways Program, the Parker Foundation Save the Redwoods League, and more.

The Pfeiffer Falls Trail is a 0.75-mile trail that takes walkers under the region’s iconic redwoods through a gorge that leads to a 60-foot waterfall known as the Pfeiffer Falls. 

The renovations include a newly constructed 70-foot-long pedestrian bridge that spans the Pfeiffer Redwood Creek ravine, the replacement of  4,150 square feet of asphalt for new passageways. [mn-post-ender]
