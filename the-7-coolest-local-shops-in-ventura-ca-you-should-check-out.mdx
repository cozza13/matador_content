Surf shops like Walden Surfboards really help set the tone, and beach lovers and surfers alike will feel right at home here. Founder Steve Walden is known as the "father of the modern longboard" (Walden still holds the record for the longest noseride in competition history with a 25.5-second ride), and you can pick up one of his iconic longboards here before hiting Ventura's local surf.
