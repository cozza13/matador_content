Visiting the Golden State on a budget isn’t easy, so when a California wine town offers you $100 to visit, you take it. The coastal city of San Luis Obispo, California, is giving $100 vouchers to the first 750 people who book two consecutive nights in a local lodging of their choice, up until March 31. 

Located halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, San Luis Obispo is the perfect overnight stop for travelers driving along the iconic Highway 1. 

San Luis Obispo is a great spot for those who like to spend time outdoors hiking, mountain biking, and climbing, as well as wildlife viewing (there are plenty of southern elephant seals and California condors to spot in San Luis Obispo County). Visitors who are more into chilling with a beer or glass of wine in hand should know that wine country in San Luis Obispo County is Napa-level, with Paso Robles, Edna Valley, and Arroyo Grande recognized as award-winning American Viticultural Areas. The SLO Craft Beer Festival runs on  February 21 and 22 -- that’s what we call perfect timing. 

The voucher deal applies to two-night stays at San Luis Obispo’s qualified lodging properties from now to March 31, with blackout dates of January 18 and 19 and February 16 and 17. More information on the initiative is available on the official tourism website. [mn-post-ender]
