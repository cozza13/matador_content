A resort with both history and legend

The property’s story dates back hundreds of years to the original inhabitants of the land — the Pomo, Coast Miwok, and Wappo peoples — who were the first to discover the natural underground hot mineral waters used in the spa today and considered the area a sacred healing ground.

The mineral springs the Inn sits on today were commercially developed for the first time in 1840. In 1895 when Captain H.E. Boyes struck 112-degree water 70 feet below the surface while drilling a well, the Boyes Hot Springs Hotel was soon to follow on the site of the current hotel. Before long, San Franciscans were arriving in droves to experience this new phenomenon of “heated soaking.”

In 1923, a devastating fire burned down most of Boyes Hot Springs, but the Inn was reborn in 1927, reconstructed as an accurate replica of a California Mission, welcoming guests to what’s known today as one of the most luxurious Inns in Northern California.

The Inn has since gone through various owners over the decades, including a brief closure during The Great Depression and a stint being operated by the U.S. Navy, who used the property as a destination for rest and recuperation for sailors and marines until 1945. In 1980 the property underwent a massive renovation, returning it to its original splendor of 1920s design.
A rundown of amenities at the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn &amp; Spa

The Spa as we know it today officially opened in 1981, attracting visitors again to experience the healing mineral waters (this time from around the globe), and when the property acquired the Sonoma Golf Club in 1998, it became the only complete destination resort experience in the Sonoma Country wine region. There have been several renovations since, constantly keeping the property and its amenities up to date with the highest standards of luxury.

Guests can spend time lounging in the luxurious rooms or getting cozy with a glass of wine out by one of the various firepits sprinkled throughout the property. The interior design of the public spaces and individual rooms pay homage to the Inn’s rich historical heritage as a landmark in Sonoma County while also offering the upscale amenities desired by the modern traveler.

There are ample dining options to enjoy on-site. Visit 38° North Wine Bar to experience Sonoma's hottest lounge setting. This venue boasts a sleek design fitting the property’s minimalist aesthetic while also offering maximum enjoyment of big and bold quality wines. The inspiration behind this unique lounge and its name is the temperate latitude of the 38th parallel, where many well-known wine regions of the world are perched — including Spain's Alicante, Italy’s Calabria, and of course, Sonoma Valley.

For a more casual dining experience, stop by Water Tower Bar — a full-service bar featuring a thoughtful selection of regional craft beers and handcrafted cocktails paired with a Sonoma-inspired menu of fresh food in a lively atmosphere adjacent to the pool. Or, visit Californi, an elevated Airstream outpost set in front of the property, serving seasonally-inspired, locally sourced Sonoma street eats in a laid-back outdoors setting.

Those seeking a more formal dining experience can stop into Santé at Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn, which serves “California fusion with a Sonoma passion.” The culinary team aims to serve dishes with simple preparation using local and sustainable ingredients. The approachable menu features a multitude of flavors, cooking styles, and recipes from many different cultures.

The resort fee of the Inn goes above and beyond a standard resort fee, covering a myriad of added amenities — starting with the offering of a “Sparkling Wine Country” welcome arrival experience. Each guest 21+ will receive a glass of bubbly upon arrival at Wine Country, and there’s also a welcome bottle of wine waiting for visitors to enjoy in their room.

This fee also covers experiential offerings, such as a daily wine tasting pouring Sonoma and Napa’s finest from 4:30 P.M. to 5:30 P.M. each day — and docent-led hikes every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday mornings from 8 A.M. to 10 A.M.

Other included amenities include self-parking, 24/7 access to the resort gym and fitness studio, bicycle rentals (based on availability), complimentary coffee and tea in the lobby until 11 o'clock each morning, access to lawn games strewn across the property (including a bocce court), and an on-site shuttle service that takes guests to Sonoma Plaza for off-site exploration, and the Sonoma Golf Club.
Beyond wine touring, the hotel is a haven for golfers and pets

Golf aficionados will revel in a trip to the Sonoma Golf Club — a private club reserved for members and their guests, as well as guests staying at the property. The 18-hole, par 72 course was designed in 1928 and was the former home of the PGA Champions Tour Charles Schwab Cup Championship. It’s set on 177 acres of well-manicured terrain featuring beautiful sights of lakes, vistas, and the neighboring vineyards.

The Inn is dog-friendly, welcoming furry family members for an added fee. There’s even a friendly “Director of Pet Relations” named Chardonnay (full name Chardonnay Madison Fairmont) serving as the official Canine Ambassador. Guests can find (and pet!) Chardonnay with a proper belly rub as she greets guests in the lobby and around the hotel grounds on most weekdays.

And the incredible Fairmont Spa is open for resort guests and non-guests to enjoy for a fee that is waived with the purchase of a qualifying treatment. The 28-room treatment spa offers treatments paired with the healing waters for a special experience.

There are five thermal mineral pools ranging from 92 to 102 degrees. These ancient thermal mineral waters flow up from 1,100 feet below the surface of the resort and contain 27 different minerals.

Be sure to pop beneath the waters of the Watsu Pool to hear the sounds of relaxation, which are piped directly into the water for a unique sensorial experience. Inside the spa’s Roman-style bathhouse, guests will find a Roman soaking pool and hot tub along with a Halotherapy Sauna and an Aromatherapy Steam Room.
