Oxnard’s recently unveiled Zachari Dunes on Mandalay Beach is a destination in and of itself as the only all-suite oceanfront resort in California (and one of the only true oceanside resorts on the west coast). Geographically, it’s perfectly placed between the cities of Santa Barbara and Malibu, serving as a secluded escape to relax with breathtaking ocean sights.

The resort gets its name from the region’s storied history. In the early 1900s, Henry Oxnard, an entrepreneur and sugar tycoon, outlined his plans to use the long stretch of land along California’s Central Coast to grow and process sugar beets. He wanted to name his newly founded community after the Greek word for sugar, “Zachari,” but ultimately named the region after his namesake. Today, Zachari Dunes’ name pays homage to Henry and his original vision while giving a new meaning to the likeness of those tall, sugary sandy dunes lining the property’s perimeter and adorning the seaside landscapes of this town.

Zachari Dunes emits a laid-back, upscale vibe that properly speaks to the atmosphere of the entire Central Coast of California. There are seemingly endless activities to enjoy on-site and around town — but perhaps one of the most notable elements of the property is its guest rooms. Each room is a multi-room suite, making for exceptionally spacious accommodations to enjoy any overnight stay.
