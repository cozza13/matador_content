Real estate prices in California are notoriously high, but $3 million for a town is an absolute steal. Back in 1994, the town of Campo in Southern California was put on sale for $1.74 million, which today inflates to around $3 million. Now, Campo is back on the market. The historic 16-acre village, about an hour away from San Diego, is being sold by John Ray, a Las Vegas investor who is unloading many of his properties as he ages. 

Campo was the home of the Buffalo Soldiers, the only all African-American cavalry unit in the US Army. Currently, the small town of just under 3,000 also contains a Baptist church, cabinet shop, a post office, and the East County Lumber and Ranch Supply Shop, which is one of the town’s most profitable businesses.

Conor Brennan, the town’s listing agent, said, “This is a very unique opportunity for an investor to own the downtown portion of a small town. It’s a very unique opportunity that doesn’t come around often.”

No exact price has been set yet, but the purchase would include 28 residences and seven commercial properties. There are about 100 people living throughout these properties, and since Campo is just a mile from the US-Mexico border, many of the residents are employees of US Customs and Border Protection.
