Bay Cities Deli

 Bay Cities Italian Deli &amp; BakerySanta Monica, United StatesAs an Italian, I am biased when it comes to Italian eateries and shops. However this place blows all other shops out of the water. If you don't buy anything else make sure you get a Godmother. It's their most popular sub, and comes with salami, mortadella, cappacola, ham, prosciutto, provolone, cheese, and a ton of toppings (called The Works). It's all on a crispy Italian loaf that is made to perfection.


Opening Ceremony

 Opening CeremonyLos Angeles, United StatesI'd say the best way to describe Opening Ceremony would be to consider the place a sort of alternative to all the big names on Rodeo Drive. The items here are positioned it pretty much the same price point, except that everything seems to be geared more towards discerning customers – those that don't insist on being on the absolute cutting edge of fashion.
