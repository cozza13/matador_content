THERE'S A LOT OF CONVENIENCE IN HAVING a local beach near you. Effortlessly sliding into the water, surfing waves that you know and understand, and being home sleeping in your own bed has its own appeal.  Even though there were excellent waves everywhere around Los Angeles, I wanted more from a surf session than just a perfect wave, I was looking for a perfect adventure.  I only had a few days, so I couldn’t go too far.  I had to pick between heading south to Baja, or North to Big Sur.  It was adventure I was after, so I headed north. Big Sur’s cold water, craggy coastline, and ancient forests have always been a go-to spot for me when getting off the grid is part of the plan. [mn-post-ender]
