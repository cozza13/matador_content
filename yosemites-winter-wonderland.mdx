You haven't had the full "Yosemite Experience" until you've seen it in winter. While Yosemite's summer season drives its popularity, the park transforms into a winter wonderland after the leaves fall and the great bulk of the tourists leave. With few crowds among winter's perpetual stillness, the off-season presents an opportunity to see the park in a way summertime visitors never will. If you're willing to bundle up and brave the chill, you'll discover something truly special.

Blanketed in fresh snow, Yosemite in winter is the perfect place to snowshoe or ski wild, nearly deserted trails. You may even find yourself completely alone while standing under famous Yosemite Falls. Check out the video above as ecologist Charles Post and photographer Meg Haywood Sullivan take us around the park and show us the true, 100% Yosemite Experience. [mn-post-ender]
