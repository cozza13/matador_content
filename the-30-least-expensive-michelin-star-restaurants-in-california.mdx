Some people who look at the food first and foremost when picking a vacation destination. They search for the best restaurants in a certain city, research the local cuisine, and, for a certain set of food-loving travelers, open the famed Michelin Guide. If you’re one of those people, California is one of the best places you can visit. And don’t think only the wealthy can afford to eat at these prestigious establishments. The cheapest Michelin star restaurants in California are surprisingly affordable, and all are worth taking a detour to visit. 

California is actually the state with the most Michelin star restaurants in the United States. Most of them are, admittedly, out of the average person’s price range. However, the cheapest Michelin star restaurants in California are only a small splurge or might take just a little pre-planning to afford. For people who love to eat, what’s a little extra cash if it means sampling some of the best food in the world? The restaurants cover a wide range of cuisines, from traditional Japanese omakase, to fine French food, to all-vegetable menus that highlight California’s spectacular local farmers. And even the cheapest Michelin star restaurants in California don’t skimp on flavor or ingredients, creating menus that highlight sustainable, organic, artistically presented cuisine in chic and stylish spaces.  

These are the 30 cheapest Michelin star restaurants in California where restaurant connoisseurs of all backgrounds have the chance to experience the legendary cuisine the Sunshine State has to offer. To make the cut, the restaurant had to have a tasting menu under $200 – although reader beware that doesn't factor in the cost of a wine pairing, which will typically drive your check up. These are also only the restaurants that have a tasting or prix-fixe menu, so no Michelin-star restaurants that offer a la carte menus only will appear here. 

With those stipulations in mind, here are the cheapest Michelin star restaurants in California, what each one serves, and where to find it.

12. Shin Sushi

Where it is: 16573 Ventura Blvd, Encino, CA 91436

13. Mori Sushi

A rustic interior and open kitchen give Bell’s a modern look that rejects the typical prim Michelin star restaurant atmosphere. The guide calls the menu “unpretentious,” but the food is still creative and exciting – one must-try dish is the crepe cake, layered with crème fraîche and caviar.

Where it is: 406 Bell Street, Los Alamos, CA 93440

22. Selby's

[caption id="attachment_734627" align="alignnone" width="1600"] Photo: Selby's [/caption]

Selby’s specializes in classic American cuisine, but the Silicon Valley restaurant is also located in America’s most expensive zip code, so think filet mignon not ground chuck. There may very well be a burger on the menu, but expect it to be topped with black truffles.

How much it costs: $80 three-course prix-fixe dinner menu per person (your choice of specific dishes) plus supplements and optional caviar service

Where it is: 3001 El Camino Real, Redwood City, CA 94061

23. Gary Danko

In the culinary world, the name Gary Danko brings to mind one of America’s most esteemed chefs.

The food is American with French, Mediterranean, and luxury influences — and the wine list is as classic as the ambiance.

How much it costs: $167 five-course tasting menu, wine pairing $125 per person 

Where it is: 800 North Point St, San Francisco, CA 94109

24. The Village Pub

[caption id="attachment_734630" align="alignnone" width="1600"] Photo: The Village Pub[/caption]

When The Village Pub says that its ingredients are locally sourced, it means that some 80 percent of the produce on its menus come from its own partner ranch, SMIP. Don’t let the pub menu fool you — the San Mateo County restaurant also serves a three-course prix-fixe dinner and has more than 3,500 labels on its wine list.

How much it costs: $89 per person three-course prix-fixe dinner menu (course options) plus supplements, $75 three-course prix-fixe brunch menu (course options) plus supplements, $49 two-course prix-fixe lunch menu (course options)

Where it is: 2967 Woodside Rd, Woodside, CA 94062

25. SPQR

        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by SPQR (@spqrsf) 

Chef Matthew Accarino breaks down the Italian menu at San Francisco’s SPQR into seven categories, starting with antipasti and ending with asporto, a takeaway course that’s meant to be enjoyed privately after dessert, or dolci. Unsurprisingly, Accarino’s handmade pasta dishes get the most praise. 

How much it costs: $92 five-course menu (seven with supplement and takeaway, or asporto) with choice of antipasti, primi, secondi, and dolce courses plus set salad course, set asporto, and tartufi supplement

Where it is: 1911 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94115

26. Sorrel

        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Sorrel (@sorrelrestaurant) 

Sorrel’s cuisine is what some call Cal-Ital — that is, somewhere between Californian and Italian. For being located in one of San Francisco’s more upmarket neighborhoods, the restaurant’s decor is deceptively casual. Because as comforting as good food may be, Sorrel’s pricey ingredients are anything but homestyle.

How much it costs: $165 summer 2022 tasting menu, $95 for optional seasonal wine pairing

Where it is: 3228 Sacramento St, San Francisco, CA 94115

27. Spruce

[caption id="attachment_734629" align="alignnone" width="1600"] Photo: Spruce[/caption]

Spruce offers San Francisco eaters a classic white-tablecloth experience without the stuffiness. The cuisine is seasonal Californian — picture proteins like butter-poached salmon and perfectly pink duck breast paired with sides like carrot top pesto, grilled watermelon, and avocado mousse — but the pages-long wine list alone draws many diners. 

How much it costs: $89 three-course dinner menu (but not a set menu) with optional caviar service for $110 (kaluga), $160 (golden osetra), or $180 (reserve). $49 three-course lunch menu and $75 three-course brunch menu (also your choice of dish for every course) with the same optional caviar service

Where it is:  3640 Sacramento Street San Francisco, CA

28. Wakuriya

San Mateo’s Wakuriya is a masterclass in kaiseki — a traditional Japanese tasting experience that some consider to be the finest dining of all. But Chef Katsuhiro Yamasaki also prizes inventiveness, as evidenced by his simple yet creative plating that’s as artful as the dishes it presents.

How much it costs: $158 nine-course chef Katsuhiro Yamasaki menu

Where it is: 115 De Anza Blvd, San Mateo, CA 94402

29. Wako

Only 20 diners can patronize this unassuming omakase joint in San Francisco’s Richmond District at any given time — a little less than half of whom can snag prime seating at the sushi counter. Chef Tomoharu Nakamura slices some of the freshest fish you’ll find this side of the Pacific, but you can also supplement your meal with cold and hot dishes such as house-made sesame tofu with sea urchin, tuna katsu, and steamed egg custard.

How much it costs: $95 10-piece chef’s choice sushi tasting with “small bite dish”

Where it is: 211 Clement St, San Francisco, CA 94118

30. Madcap

Chef Ron Siegel is bringing San Francisco-grade eats to a sleek small-town dining room about 20 minutes north of the Golden Gate Bridge. Seasonal and organic, the menu at Madcap celebrates California cuisine through a Japanese lens, with minimalist decor to match.

How much it costs: $125 11-course chef’s tasting menu with a supplemental $30 course 

Where it is: 198 Sir Francis Drake Blvd, San Anselmo, CA 94960 [mn-post-ender]
