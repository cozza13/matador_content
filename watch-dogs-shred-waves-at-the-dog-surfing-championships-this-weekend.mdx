You might not be much of a surfer yourself, but that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy watching the pros tear up some gnarly waves. This weekend, some of the world’s best surfers are descending on California for the annual championship competition -- oh, and they happen to be dogs.

The 2018 Dog Surfing Championships takes place Saturday, August 4, at Linda Mar State Beach in Pacifica, California, outside San Francisco. It will bring together the world’s top dog surfers and amateurs alike for a day of summer fun. In a canine-themed surf competition, there are really no losers, but the winning dog will bring home the coveted “Golden Surfie,” and you can bet no dog wants to leave empty-handed.

In addition to the dog surfing competition itself, there will also be other activities for dogs to show off their skills. These include a ball fetch competition, a dog beach fashion contest, dog adoptions, and a whole Surf Dog Village, complete with partner tents and activities.

The best part about the event is that you can also help make a difference in the canine community. Entrants and attendees will be able to help fundraise for GoughNuts, a partner of the event and manufacturer of safe pet toys.

Whether your dog has what it takes to bring home the “Golden Surfie” or you’re just a dog-loving spectator, visit the contest’s official website for ticket and entry information.
