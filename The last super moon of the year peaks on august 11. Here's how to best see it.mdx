The last super moon of the year peaks on august 11. Here's how to best see it.	https://matadornetwork.com/read/supermoon-august-2022/	"The last supermoon of the year has already started, and since the next one isn’t coming until August 2023, you don’t want to miss it. The event began Wednesday but won’t be visible to the naked eye until 9:36 PM EDT on August 10 when it will appear opposite the sun in Earth-based longitude until Saturday morning, according to NASA.


A supermoon appears bigger and brighter because it’s within 90 percent of its closest point, or perigee, to Earth. A supermoon typically appears 17 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than when the moon is farthest from Earth. There have been four supermoons this year — one in May, one in June, and one in July. However, the moons in June and July were closer and therefore bigger and brighter than tonight.

This supermoon, called the Sturgeon Moon, was named by the Indigenous Algonquin tribes that lived in the northeastern United States after the large fish that were easy to catch that time of year in the Great Lakes, according to CBS News. It’s also been called the Green Corn Moon.

Simultaneously, the best meteor shower of the year, the Perseid meteor shower, will reach its peak this Thursday through Saturday, but since the moon will be so bright, it might be challenging to see. Experts suggest looking for the meteors after midnight on Saturday morning, far from light pollution and looking north away from the light of the moon.

If you’ve ever felt like getting a good shot of the moon on camera is impossible, you’re not alone. That’s why NASA has released a guide to taking photos of the moon on a cell phone, camera, or telescope, though it probably still won’t do it justice. "
