PROFESSIONAL SURFER DAMIEN HOBGOOD needs to live by the ocean. "What I love about surfing is the freedom to go out and do whatever you want. The freedom to express yourself on a wave the way you want to do it." But what's a pro surfer to do if he wants to surf and then snowboard in the same day?

Fortunately, Hobgood lives in Southern California, where the drive between the beaches and the snow-capped mountains is just a couple of hours. So he can surf in the morning, hop into his truck, and head to the mountains for some afternoon snowboarding (which is basically surfing down the slopes). Life ain't bad. [mn-post-ender]
