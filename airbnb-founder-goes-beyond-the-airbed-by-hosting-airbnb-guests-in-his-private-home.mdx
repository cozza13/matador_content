In 2007 Brian Chesky and his roommate Joe Gebbia blew up some air mattresses and allowed three guests to stay in their home, birthing the idea of Airbnb (airbed and breakfast, as the pair were reportedly proficient at whipping up a few eggs in the morning). Fifteen years later, the company has amassed over 4 million Airbnb hosts worldwide. Now Chesky, CEO and co-founder of the company, is inviting guests into his home again in San Francisco, California. Only this time, guests will hardly have to settle for an air mattress on the floor. Instead, they will enjoy a stunning guest suite and time with Chesky and his golden retriever, Sophie.

If you have ever been curious about Airbnb's beginnings, this suite's artwork includes personal photos and artifacts from the early days of Airbnb. Guests can enjoy a panoramic view of the Castro neighborhood and the rental is furnished with an armchair, a desk, and a plush queen bed with a much more comfortable mattress. Guests will also have access to two large closets and a full bathroom with a large shower, and they can hang out in the living room with floor-to-ceiling windows that let the light flood in or the outdoor patio with a fireplace along with a stunning view.

The home is near the Mission, Castro, and Noe Valley neighborhoods, with many great boutiques, restaurants, and coffee shops nearby. If guests prefer to cook over takeout, the spacious chef's kitchen upstairs has everything you need, but you'll also be just a short walk from San Francisco favorites like Bi-Rite ice cream and the world-famous Tartine bakery for fresh bread and pastries. Be sure to get out and enjoy neighborhood favorites like the beautiful Dolores Park.
