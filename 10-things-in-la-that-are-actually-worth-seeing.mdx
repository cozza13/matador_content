In a city as big and bursting at the seams as Los Angeles it can be hard to separate what is wack from what is actually worth seeing. My ‘actually worth seeing’ travelstoke® list draws from well known tourist attractions and lesser known POI’s alike. These are a few spots that I might take a friend visiting Los Angeles who wants a to experience both LA the icons and hidden local hangs. [mn-post-ender]
1. Venice Skate Park

 Venice Skate ParkLos Angeles, United StatesKeep your camera ready at the Venice Beach Skate Park. In the heart of the Venice Beach boardwalk scene, the skate park is a welcome distraction on the way to the sand. There is always of talented and not-so-talented skaters trying for some trick. #venicebeach #skatepark


2. Art district wall

 Art district wallLos Angeles, United StatesOn your way to Angel City Brewery wander the sidealks of the Arts District and admire some of the coolest street art in Los Angeles. The quality of creativity on display is incredible and there is plenty of food and drink everywhere. This shiz is Instagram gold! #art #streetart #free


3. The Echo

 The EchoLos Angeles, United StatesThis rad little Echo Park venue is a good place to catch up and coming bands, drink overpriced PBR and generally have a good time. Plenty of taco trucks in the area to take care of any post show munchies... #livemusic #echopark


4. Pacific Cinerama Dome

 Pacific Cinerama DomeLos Angeles, United StatesAn amazing movie-going experience, easily one of the best theaters in LA...since the Cinerama isn't exactly cheap, I save my visits for special occasions. Right next to the Archlight movie theater and parking options. #movietheater #hollywood


5. Route 66 "end of trail" sign

 Route 66 'end of trail' SignSanta Monica, United StatesOn the Santa Monica Pier is a sign making the western terminus of the famous cross country car route - Route 66. The sign is in the middle of touristville and there is nealy always someone snapping a selfie, but it really is a cool landmark harkening back to a bygone icon of Americana. #santamonica #beach #history


6. Griffith Park Observatory

8. Old Chinatown

 Old ChinatownLos Angeles, United StatesOld China town is bordered by traditional paifang gates - a super photogenic icon of this historic dtla neighborhood. Old Chinatown is great for people watching, grabbing a bite to eat (at nearby Golden Dragon, or my fave - Burgerlords!) and check out the old buildings. There is also a 7 foot statue of Bruce Lee, awesome!

9. Bronson Canyon-Griffith Park

 Bronson Canyon-Griffith ParkLos Angeles, United StatesYou see that? That's pretty much all of LA.
And my bike. Behind me is a huge view of the Hollywood sign. The best views, trails, wildlife viewing and sunset vistas are in Griffith Park. There are more hiking trails than you could possibly cover in one day, or one week for that matter. This is the LA you never knew existed. #hiking #park


10. Lake Hollywood Park

 Lake Hollywood ParkLos Angeles, United StatesA little dog park between Griffith Park and the Hollywood Reservoir, just below the HOLLYWOOD sign, this patch of grass is super popular with locals and visitors alike. I like to come and play with other people's dogs. #dogfriendly #park #hollywood
