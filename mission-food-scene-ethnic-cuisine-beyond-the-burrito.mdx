San Francisco's Mission District may be famous for its burritos, but this neighborhood offers far more diverse dining options than the taquería.
Bombay Ice Creamery
While Bi-Rite is the undisputed Mission favorite for ice cream, Bombay Ice Creamery offers a far more exotic variety made with more cream and less sugar. While Indians prefer flavors like rose petal, saffron pistachio, and cardamom, you can still score scoops of cookies &amp; cream, rocky road, or plain vanilla if the exotic flavors aren't to your liking.

And while you can't order a hot fudge sundae with whipped cream and a cherry on top, you can instead indulge in a falooda, their version of an ice cream float, where the ice cream comes with milk, rose syrup, vermicelli, and flavored seeds called tukhmalanga. Or try a kulfi, their version of a sundae.

Limon
I'd never tasted ceviche before celebrating my birthday at Limon a couple of years ago, and it was then I realized what I'd been missing.

Limon's cevichería offers up a variety of choices, including a fish-less "veggie shooter" with diced vegetables and choclo, (an Andean corn). But if you're not a raw fish fan, there are a selection of entrées that include lomo saltado and arroz con mariscos (beef sauteéd with onions and spices, and rice with seafood).

Limon Rotisserie
Peruvians also do a mean rotisserie chicken at Limon's sister restaurant, Limon Rotisserie. The pollo a la brasa can be ordered in a quarter, half, or full portions, and comes with a choice of sides like yuca frita and vegetales salteados. There's also the option of going tapas-style with a variety of hot and cold small plates, such as halibut ceviche in lime juice, garlic, and rocot (hot pepper) and grilled hangar steak.

La Oaxaqueña
I'm surprised there aren't more restaurants in the city specializing in the cuisine of the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Which makes me appreciate La Oaxaqueña even more with its giant tlayudas (crisp fried tortilla topped with refried beans fresh Oaxacan cheese, lettuce, avocado, and your meat of choice), delicious chicken mole tamales wrapped in banana leaves, and Oaxacan hot chocolate.

Even when sharing with a friend, you're guaranteed to get stuffed, and the food is cheap. Adventurous eaters can try the grasshopper tacos (when they're in season).

The restaurant also doubles as a bakery, which means there's a selection of Mexican sweet breads (not to be confused with the American kind) as well as flan available.

Poc Chuc
Just off the Mission Street taquería drag, you won't be able to order a burrito at this Mayan and Spanish fusion restaurant. More formal than most Mission establishments, Poc Chuc serves up a delicious assortment of dishes like grilled marinated citrus pork (the restaurant's eponymous dish), pollo pibil , and panuchos (fried tortillas filled with a black bean puree topped with shredded turkey, cabbage marinated in lemon, pickled red onions and avocado).

A meal here could leave you dreaming of heading to the Yucatán.

Food from Germany, India, Belgium and Senegal after the jump!
Walzwerk
The may have ceased to exist 20 years ago, but if you happen to have any longings to take a trip to the former Eastern Bloc, this is your chance. As soon as you enter the door, you're greeted by a sign announcing your entrance into the Soviet sector.

The restaurant, which serves up Eastern German dishes like grilled Thüringer bratwurst, beef roulade , cheese Spätzle , and Jäger schnitzel , recreates the Cold War atmosphere with utilitarian tables and Communist relics. The only missing element is the surly service.

Dosa

So often when I go out for Indian food, I wind up ordering curry. There's nothing wrong with chicken tikka masala or vindaloo, it's just that I'd like to be able to diversify my Indian dining experiences.
Dosa at Dosa: mlinvska

It's easy to do so at South Indian restaurants, like Dosa, with their varied array of organic dishes like Chennai chicken, bite-sized pieces of meat marinated in yogurt, coriander, and cumin, and the namesake Dosa (lentil dumplings, and uttapam, a thicker, open-faced version of a dosa).

If you do insist on having curry, though, I highly recommend the Bagara Baingan, an eggplant curry in a peanut sauce.

Frjtz
San Francisco may lack a Grand Place and a statue of a little boy urinating, but it does offer Frjtz, a casual restaurant serving moules et frites a la Belgique. Well, not exactly. This being San Francisco, Frjtz puts a more exotic twist on these Belgian favorites.

You can choose to have your mussels cooked in the traditional white wine, butter, parsley, and garlic, or go for the Thai, Mexican, and Greek interpretations with ingredients like coconut milk, lemongrass, chipotle, and kalamata olives. The frites can be ordered plain, with garlic, or spicy, and come with your choice of dipping sauces - the wide selection includes pesto mayo, strawberry mustard, and white truffle artichoke ketchup.

Bissap Baobab
San Francisco (and indeed, the United States) has a dearth of African cuisine. Bissap Baobab helps fill that void with its Senegalese specialties like mafe, a heavenly dish of vegetables smothered in a peanut sauce, and its famous tiep dien, a red snapper with Jolof rice.

The restaurant shines in the beverage department as well, with juices made from ginger and hibiscus and a coconut-infused rum.
