Once upon a time, Los Angeles was known as The City of Vines. There were over 100 wine producers in the area. The success of the wine industry throughout California (which began in the 18th century with the Spanish missions) was built upon the labor of indigenous workers and other immigrants. Once the missions became secularized, both Mexican and European people established vineyards on those lands. One of those immigrants was Jean Louis Vignes, a Frenchman who cultivated 100 acres of vines and citrus in the original Pueblo of Los Angeles where Union Station is today.  

When California became part of the United States in 1850, Los Angeles much more rural that it is today, and yet it was still the epicenter of California wine.  By the 1850s and 60s, the progression of the wine industry was in full swing, with German winemakers Frohling and Kohler leading the way. 

The wine industry took a big hit in the 1880s when Pierce’s disease (which kills the leaves on the grapevines) struck hard. Following that period, Prohibition, urbanization, and the proliferation of citrus farms marked the end of Los Angeles as the epicenter of California wine. But there are still Los Angeles wineries that are well worth a visit on your next trip.

Today, there’s a new chapter being written on Los Angeles wine production. Los Angeles wineries and tasting rooms are once again thriving in Los Angeles County, although most people probably consider Napa the true heart of California wine.

Along with a small group of winemakers dedicated to reviving interest in crafting wines of high quality from Los Angeles County fruit, other winemakers are opening tasting rooms, but growing or buying their fruit elsewhere. These Los Angeles wineries will surprise and delight you, and offer a urban setting to sip your wine -- an interesting change of pace from the usual rural setting where vineyards are usually located. From chic Malibu tasting rooms to the oldest existing winery in Los Angeles, these five tasting rooms provide a selection of what’s available in The City of Vines.

San Antonio Winery has been located at the original address on Lamar Street since 1917, though the vineyards are long gone. Owned by the Riboli family, the namesake wines produced under the Maddalena label pay tribute to the matriarch of the winery. Maddalena also had the vision to start a restaurant on site (called, appropriately, Maddalena Restaurant) and to purchase vineyards in Napa Valley, Monterey County, and Paso Robles.

San Antonio Winery has a large selection of wines including sparkling wines, white and red wines, and sweet wines. The winery has survived the urbanization of Los Angeles, Pierce’s Disease, and prohibition, by producing wine for the Catholic Church. San Antonio Winery is a look back into Los Angeles’ golden age of winemaking. Don’t miss it.

The winery is open for tastings and tours. Both the winery and the restaurant are open daily.

Malibu Wines And Beer Garden

If you’re looking for more to drink than just wine, Malibu Wines and Beer Garden might be the place for you. The Mission-style building is almost 100 years old and was built by a silent film star. Weekends are busy with activities like yoga in the garden, local craft sales, and food trucks. You should also know that the current owners have an 1100 acre ranch where they grow all the fruit for the Saddlerock Estate label wines.

It’s worth a visit just to taste wines made from grapes grown in the Malibu AVA. Try the estate sparkling rosé. The other label is Saddlerock––those grapes are from Northern California vineyards. Malibu Wine Hikes is the winery’s sister company, which specializes in excursions that end in gorgeous views with a bottle of wine and many photo ops. The hikes actually take you through the Saddlerock vineyards.
