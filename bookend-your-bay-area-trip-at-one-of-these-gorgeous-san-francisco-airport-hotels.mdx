Grand Hyatt at SFO
[gallery ids="687135,687133,687134,687132" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Located adjacent to the airport’s main entrance, the Grand Hyatt at SFO is a quick walk from all terminals. Bookending a trip to San Francisco is super easy and convenient here, with an onsite bar and fitness center (in case the airport yoga room wasn’t enough), and gorgeous rooms overlooking the airport property. Watching planes take off and land is a surprisingly soothing way to fall asleep. Moreso when you know that all you have to do to get to your flight in the morning is take the elevator downstairs to hit security.

The hotel’s restaurant serves food late and can arrange for early-morning breakfast to be delivered to your room. At concierge, 24-hour desk service can connect you with services either at the airport or in San Francisco itself, which is a 15-to-20-minute Uber ride or under 30 minutes on the BART train. Plus, milk (or use) those World of Hyatt rewards points here.

The Dylan Hotel
[gallery ids="687130,687131,687128,687129" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Boutique hotels that are actually boutique are a rarity these days. Boutique airport hotels are even rarer. The Dylan Hotel San Francisco Airport is both, and it does an incredible job of providing a unique and memorable hotel stay just over one mile from the airport. The experience is truly San Franciscan – modern and with luxe amenities and WiFi, and also within five minutes’ walk of a plethora of delicious restaurants. And, the BART picks up just up the street, or an Uber to the terminal is quick and painless. The hotel features a bar, a coworking station, and plenty of character – and don’t miss the afternoon happy hour in the lobby.

Aloft San Francisco Airport
[gallery ids="687121,687122,687124,687123" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Aloft is a Marriott-backed boutique that adds a colorful, clean airport hotel experience just adjacent from SFO. Here at Aloft SFO, everything from the pool to the tricked-out lobby to the catchy art in the rooms is part of the experience. Guests love sitting over a drink on the patio or shooting a game of pool in the lounge. In-room, beds are super comfy and swap that useless box spring for a thick mattress on platform. The place is helplessly hip, and if any San Francisco airport hotels speak to the contemporary age of bleisure travel and remote work, it’s this one.

Westin San Francisco Airport
[gallery ids="687120,687119,687117,687118" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Westin is an iconic brand known for its upscale wellness focus, of particular relevance in a progressive city like San Francisco. The Westin San Francisco Airport is about a mile from both the airport itself and the airport BART station. Rooms feature Westin’s Heavenly Beds and offer picturesque views of the south Bay Area and of the San Francisco Bay. The real perk of staying here, though, is the onsite Grill &amp; Vine restaurant, which serves well-heeled fare and nice cocktails reminiscent of San Francisco’s urban core moreso than an airport hotel village.

Ramada Limited and Suites San Francisco Airport
[gallery ids="687106,687105" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Ramada Limited and Suites San Francisco Airport occupies a unique place in the lexicon of airport hotels. It’s as though the brand was built for this – efficient dining and room service for travelers in and out quickly is a standard. As is rapid WiFi. And a clean, comfortable in-room experience that is familiar enough to feel approachable, but refined enough to make you feel a little better about that 6:30 am flight in the morning. The Ramada San Francisco airport hotel is 1.5 miles from SFO and only slightly further from the South San Francisco Convention Center.

La Quinta by Wyndham San Francisco Airport West
[gallery ids="687104,687103,687102" size="full" type="slider"  /]

The “west” in the La Quinta San Francisco Airport West’s name is both ironic and fortunate at the same time. If it were east of the airport, you’d be sleeping in the San Francisco Bay. It’s also convenient as the airport terminal exits towards the hotel, just a quick shuttle ride from baggage claim. Onsite, take advantage of the hotel’s expansive outdoor pool and lounge area, an ideal place to relax while preparing for – or after – a long day of travel. This pet-friendly hotel has free WiFi and a strong continental breakfast (the type where you’ll have to resist pocketing a few items to take with you through security). Rooms are cozy and while standard, are clean and quiet. [mn-post-ender]
