The hospitality industry is getting a major overhaul in the COVID-19 era, and that even includes room service. To limit touchpoints and interaction between guests and staff, one hotel uses a room service robot called Rosé, whose sole job is to deliver goodies to your room. 

Hotel Trio in Healdsburg, CA, is enlisting the services of Rosé the Robot to provide state-of-the-art service in the era of social distancing, delivering wine, or anything else your heart desires, right to your room. The robot can autonomously travel down hallways, onto elevators, and locate guest rooms while flashing a message en route that says, “I’m on a guest delivery.” 

Brooke Ross, director of Hotel Trio, told Sonoma Magazine, “In addition to Rosé being super helpful, people absolutely love her. We have a beautiful lobby, a really great bar, bocce balls that light up when you play at night, but Rosé is hands down the most frequently photographed feature of our hotel.”

Since the hotel is located close to several Sonoma County wineries, including Dry Creek Vineyard, Flanagan Winery, and Francis Ford Coppola Winery, Rosé the Robot will be delivering some of the area’s best local wines.

In addition to Rosé, Hotel Trio is also implementing other measures to keep people safe and reduce unnecessary interaction, including mandatory mask-wearing and heightened sanitation measures. [mn-post-ender]
