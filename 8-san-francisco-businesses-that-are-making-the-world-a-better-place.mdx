

From the city that brought you the Sierra Club, the Plastic Bag Ban, and the most green space of any municipality in the US, these responsible San Francisco businesses are making an effort to blend environmental ethics with financial success. Furthermore, they’re showcasing premium products worthy of your hard-earned dollars.  
 
You’re going to spend a few extra bucks by shopping SF-made, but if that item lasts three times as long a mass-produced competitor, you could potentially save money in the long term. This is why Danny Hess strives to craft wooden surf boards that you can pass on to your kids, and the same reason companies like Timbuk2 have a lifetime warranty.  Below is a list of must-visit SF businesses offering a fresh alternative to disposable consumerism.
