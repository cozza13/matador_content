 1. Pre-Kings pastrami and blue corn tacos. Need I say more? 
 
    Grilling equals work. Oven equals more time for booze and friends. Extra Cochinita pibil from last night's tacos repurposed into monster chilaquiles (shout out to #laflordeyucatan for the achiote paste) slow roasted pork shoulder, chipotle roasted sweet potatoes, black beans, braising liquid, quick pickled red onions, jalapeños, tangerine habanero sauce, eggs, lime &#x1f44c;&#x1f3fb;&#x1f389; A photo posted by Hillary Eaton (@hilleaton) on May 25, 2015 at 5:21pm PDT

 
 2. Cochinita pibil, burnt orange from its marinade of achiote and sour orange juice, is sold by the pound so you can go home and make your own. 
  
 3. More than likely they'll come with a side of ilegal Mezcal. 
 
    "Aguacatero" from Tacoteca in Santa Monica. Ilegal Mezcal, avocado, Green Chartreuse, Lime. Garnished with chapulines and sal de gusano. Made by @gilbertmezcal A photo posted by L.A. TACO (@lataco) on Jan 13, 2015 at 3:59pm PST

 
 4. And a chaser.

 7. They are thinking outside the box people; juicy lengua, stewed beef tongue taco.

 8. Yet somethings are standard; salsa verde, chipotle crema, lime and pico de gallo. 
 
    If you have a short list of must-try #tacos, get #CasaLaDoña on there stat! So good you'll close your eyes to fully enjoy these #authentic flavors. Did #MexicoCity get #teleported to #DowntownLA? Robust #alpastor with #piña (yes!) and #homemade corn tortillas. Ridiculously tasty shredded marinated pork #cochinitapibil on #TacoTuesdays only. 15 different types (whaaaa?) of homemade #salsas made fresh every day ranging from mild to rip-your-lips-off hot. We loved the spicy bright #green and #smoky chipotle. This #tacogem could very well be the #Cinderella story at the 2015 #TacoMadness in March, @LATaco! "La Doña" name honors their #mom (whose traditional #recipes owners Alicia and her sister have embraced and used as inspiration to expand the #menu) and the most famous movie star from the #goldenage of #Mexicancinema, #MariaFelix. #DTLA #xploreLA #LAlife #DF #besttacos #realmexicanfood #tacolife A photo posted by Search for the Perfect Taco (@searchfortheperfecttaco) on Nov 13, 2014 at 8:37am PST

 
 9. Braised pork shoulder sous-vide with tortillas handmade to order. 
 
    Do you see these crispy rolls of fried #cheese-encrusted meat?! Definitely unexpected and instantly transported me to #costra heaven at #ElCalifa and @lacasadelpastor in #MexicoCity! Fantastic #happyhour #tacotrio with homemade tortillas: heaping and juicy #carnitas, well-flavored and perfectly cooked chicken #alpastor (with #pineapple) and super fresh #zucchini/squash/queso. Impressed with the #Mexican #streetfood menu, friendly #service and ideal #SanDiego #alfresco restaurant dining experience. Definitely check out @eatpuesto and look forward to the #SDtacotrade! #organic #sehablafresh #tacolife #LaJolla #tacos #latergram #Puesto A photo posted by Search for the Perfect Taco (@searchfortheperfecttaco) on Apr 10, 2015 at 4:06pm PDT

 11. Ain't a view like this at a NYC taco truck. 
 
    Everything that an inauthentic #breakfasttaco should have: #eggs, #bacon (¡gracias!), chorizo, #tatertots, #cheddarcheese and #sriracha sour cream and quite possibly the most breathtaking #nature view I've had eating tacos. (Oh, and the tongue-searing #ghostpepper salsa!) You know you're in for a bit of #tacoparadise when you enter #SanElijo State #Beach to park, watch #surfers at their morning ritual and chill on @bulltaco's patio on the cliffs. Def need to hit them up for lunch/dinner for shrimp curry, duck or #surfnturf #tacos.

 12. Taquitos fit in perfectly with the SoCal diet.  [mn-post-ender]

    In the shadow on the right at 3 o'clock is the magic chile #aioli sauce that made these little grilled #shrimp rolled #Taquitos "La Capital" fantastic! No wonder it's #LaCapital #restaurant's signature appetizer. Food is spot on #mexican with a gourmet twist, very attentive service in a super hip, #gastropub ambience at #MexicoCity's trendy #Condesa neighborhood. Forgot to try the #awardwinning fideo seco soup (#nexttime) but the #sweetpotato, #plantain and #papasfritas were a nice change with their delicious #guac with #pomegranate seeds! #gourmettacos #tacolife #latergram #tacos #CDMX #huntgrammexico #tacotourMexCity A photo posted by Search for the Perfect Taco (@searchfortheperfecttaco) on Feb 25, 2015 at 7:56am PST
