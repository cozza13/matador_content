Decorated in the spirit of Revolutionary China, locals come from near and far for the stuffed baos, which are soft doughy buns that can either be baked or steamed, and they're what's made this truck so legendary. The crowd favorite is probably the Tender Pork Belly, but there are plenty of other meat options to choose from, plus the vegetarian choices that are all equally enticing too. They also have rice bowls and noodle salads with a wide selection of proteins and veggies. It's pretty easy to find a healthy meal here.

This truck does an excellent job of proving that fusion is always a good idea. They blend Indian and Mexican flavors effortlessly. They're pretty popular for the chicken tikka masala burrito that features tender pieces of chicken with turmeric rice and garbanzo beans. And if you want to try something new, the deconstructed samosas -- garbanzo beans, pico de gallo, chutneys and mini samosas -- may sound a bit odd, but they're pretty addictive.

Combining the best of both worlds, this food truck doles out classic Filipino flavors with a Mexican twist. Their burritos are the star of the show and include a protein, Adobo garlic rice, pinto beans, pico de gallo, and their signature cilantro cream sauce. And if you're just in the mood for a smaller snack, the Sisig Nachos do not disappoint.

First of all, let’s clear one thing up: this taco truck is no ordinary taco truck. It has a cult following with its uber-popular tacos filled with carne asada, pollo asadas and carnitas, as well as lengua (soft beef tongue), cabeza (beef head), and tripitas (crispy tripe). They also have burritos, quesadillas and tortas for those who want something more substantial.

The name refers to a mash-up of Korean and Japanese flavors, but it also doubles as the name of their addictive signature dish: a burger-like creation with your choice of a Korean BBQ protein between two fried garlic rice buns. If you still have room, make sure to split an order of the mighty Kamikaze Fries, which are waffle fries smothered in minced Korean BBQ beef, Japanese mayo, and kimchi.

This duck-centric food truck is all about serving this feathery fowl in various, creative ways. Choose from dishes like house-cured duck pastrami sliders, smoked duck ramen and duck confit tacos. If you want to take it up a notch, make sure to go on a day when their foie gras ramen is on the board.

If you haven’t gotten on the Japanese crepe train, this mobile eatery will convince you otherwise. Savory crepe fans rave about the Okonomi Crepe that was inspired after the traditional Japanese savory pancake Okonomiyaki. For dessert, check out their sweet crepes, like the indulgent Strawberry Shortcake Crepe.

For a taste of New England seafood in the Bay Area, this food truck is bound to fulfill all your cravings with their famous Sam’s Lobster Rolls, New England Clam Chowder, Crab Cakes, and Fish and Chips. After a few bites, you can’t help but imagine seaside seafood shacks, and the salty ocean breeze of the Atlantic. Make sure to save room for a side of fries covered in Old Bay seasoning.

Whether you are looking for a healthy start to your day or a nourishing midday pick-me-up, these frozen fruit-based treats are the answer. The base is a creamy frozen acai root blend with an added layer of granola, topped with various fruit and coconut shavings. If you're not sure what to order the OG is a wise place to start.

Stopping by Menlo Park Caltrain tonight!  Eat at the truck or take some empanadas home! #elsursf #otgsf #empanadastogoPosted by El Sur SF on Wednesday, March 30, 2016

For empanadas-enthusiasts, this is the place to go for high-quality pockets of deliciousness. The Traditional is a favorite with hand cut Five Dot Ranch beef, onions, pimento, hard-boiled egg, olive and oregano. For something a little more adventurous, try the Parisian with country ham, prosciutto and five kinds of cheeses. It will be hard to miss the truck itself because it’s a flashy vintage 1970 Citroen H-Van. [mn-post-ender]
