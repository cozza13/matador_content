If you love hiking, national parks are the perfect place in the US for a vacation or day trip. But with summer quickly approaching, beloved favorites like Yosemite are guaranteed to be packed (though some national parks can be way less crowded).

Planning a trip to a national park can be overwhelming, with multiple trailheads and park entrances, new reservation systems in response to the pandemic, and subjective rating systems that make it hard to gauge how challenging a trail truly is.  So to help upcoming visitors out, WorldMark by Wyndham, which owns several vacation clubs close to some of the best national parks in the country, launched a new hiking concierge package in late May.

The lodging company partnered with Ash Nudd, a former park ranger and creator of the Dirt In My Shoes hiking blog, to create the hiking concierge package. Each package includes a personalized video from Nudd with expert tips on navigating national parks and an access code to download a detailed park itinerary on the Dirt In My Shoes website. Guests will receive customized recommendations for what to do while in the various parks as well as itineraries, packing tips, and more.

"Millions of people are flocking to national parks each year to witness the natural beauty and awe-inspiring sights this country has to offer, which means [the parks] are busier than ever," Nudd said in a traveler-facing statement. "As the official WorldMark by Wyndham Hiking Concierge, I will provide you with access to a designated park itinerary that helps you avoid the crowds and tips for seeing the best sights, helping you make the most of your vacation."

The hiking concierge service is available at five WorldMark by Wyndham properties:

 	The Moab Resort, a WorldMark by Wyndham Associate Resort – near Arches National Park in Utah
 	WorldMark Bass Lake– near Yosemite National Park in California
 	WorldMark West Yellowstone – near Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming
 	WorldMark St. George – near Zion National Park in Utah
 	WorldMark Estes Park – near Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.

To be eligible for the hiking concierge promotion, travelers must book a minimum of two nights by December 31, 2022, for travel by March 31, 2023, and use the booking code "Hike22."  Unlike traditional Wyndham Hotels, WorldMark by Wyndham properties are time-shares and condos, which means guests can book multi-room suites with separate living spaces, laundry facilities, and even fully equipped kitchens in some destinations.  [mn-post-ender]
