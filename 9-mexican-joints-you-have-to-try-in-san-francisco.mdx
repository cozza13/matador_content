JONESING FOR SOME MEXICAN FOOD in the city by the Bay? Don't worry. We've got you covered. We dipped into our travelstoke app and found the best Mexican joints in San Francisco.

1. La Taqueria

Hands down the best tacos in SF. The ONLY thing to order are the "carnitas dorados tacos." Thank me later.

2. Gordo Taqueria

Gordo is one of my favorite taquerias in the city. Get the super burrito or "crispy tacos" (not on the menu).

3. The Taco Shop at Underdog's

Make sure to get the tacos "Nick's way." Great place to watch a game on TV too.

4. Papito Hayes

ORDER THE ENTIRE MENU (especially things from the sea!!)... and lots of mezcal.

6. Grindz

Okay, so technically it's Hawaiian, but those huevos rancheros with Kalua pig are amazing, and this is a great place to go on weekends when other brunch spots are packed.

7. Cala

New place in SF run by the owner of Mexico City's super famous "Contra Mar" lunch spot. Cala is awesome for drinks and food inspired by Mexico!

8. El Techo

One of my favorite sit-down Mexican restaurants in SF. The ceviche is good but the chicharones are fucking next level and sold by the pound!

9. Tacko

Same founder as Nick's Crispy Tacos, which many people in SF know well. Almost the same menu here. Like a taqueria but with really high quality meats. [mn-post-ender]
