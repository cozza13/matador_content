The first time I went to Los Angeles, I felt quite overwhelmed and had absolutely zero idea about what to see or do. After all, most Hollywood movies portray the City of Angels as a crazy, action-packed mecca of selfie-taking celebrities, crime and dirty deals. (Ever seen LA Confidential?) I was going for quite the opposite - a relaxing, laid-back weekend full of good food and local cultural landmarks. Take it easy and hit up my 8 favorite first-timer spots.

1. Downtown Arts District

2. Eggslut

 EggslutLos Angeles, United StatesEgg slut is da bomb! Love the Fairfax sandwich and the bacon egg and cheese. If you don't want bread you can get it with greens on the side. Grand central market is cool because there's a lot of diverse cuisine under the same roof. You can sit outside and enjoy your brunch. #cheap-eats #coffee


3. The Last Bookstore

 The Last BookstoreLos Angeles, United StatesA big book store located in downtown Los Angeles. Wide variety of reads, plus a creepy, mysterious, enticing vibe. You'll spot the occasional hipster lurking in the fiction corner. Live readings are pretty cool and you can definitely get some sweet photo opps. #history #free #losangeles #read

6. Calle Tacos

 Calle TacosLos Angeles, United StatesLet me tell you, I used to hate tacos because I'd never had a good one, until this place. First time out to the west coast and Calle Tacos blew my mind. The fish taco is so fluffy, so crispy, so flavorful that you'll forget all your worries and beg for more. They've got a food truck (because who doesn't nowadays), as well as a Hollywood Blvd location. #cheap-eats #mexican


7. Griffith Park Observatory

 Griffith Park ObservatoryLos Angeles, United StatesSpectacular view of LA, day or night. Cool planetarium inside, but let's be honest, most people just go to Griffith for the insta. #free #photoop #outdoor


8. The Prince

 The PrinceLos Angeles, United StatesI went to this restaurant only because Anthony Bourain hyped it way up on the Travel Channel. Let me tell you, the spicy chicken wings are sinfully delicious. Crispy, juicy, hot, spicy, ridiculous. The spicy octopus is good, too. Pair those 2 up with a cold Corona. Restaurant atmosphere is really cool. The fancy, Victorian style decor is preserved but the menu is Korean. #fine-dinning #cheap-eats #open-late #food
