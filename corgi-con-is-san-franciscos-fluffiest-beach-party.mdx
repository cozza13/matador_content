You’ve heard of Comic-Con, but what about Corgi Con? Over 950 corgis descended on San Francisco’s Ocean Beach this weekend for the event, which included a costume contest, a race, and lots of relaxation time on the beach. You never knew you needed Corgi Con until you missed Corgi Con, right? Luckily, those who did attend documented the whole thing, so you can feel just like you were there.

If for some reason you missed this year’s Corgi Con, don’t worry. Saturday, June 23rd is Corgi Beach Day at Huntington Beach, CA, which bills itself as the “biggest corgi party on the planet.” San Diego also has corgi meetups on the fourth Saturday of every month. Their event page reads:
“Imagine 9- stubby corgis frolicking at the park or running thru the surf. Now imagine their owners laughing and discussing what makes them similar and what makes them separate personalities. That’s what this meetup is all about.”
See, there are plenty of opportunities to get your corgi fix, or connect with other enthusiasts. [mn-post-ender]
