There’s no better feeling than finding a $100 bill on the sidewalk, and there’s no worse feeling than realizing that $100 bill is attached to a string, and someone hiding in the bushes is yanking your chain. Designer Pablo Rochat is taking that classic prank to the next level, by planting fake AirPods all around downtown San Francisco and observing people’s reactions as they try to pick them up -- in vain.

According to Vice, Rochat was inspired when he noticed AirPods in the ears of everyone around him. To pull off the prank, Rochat created life-sized AirPod stickers that look exactly like the real thing.

I made life-size AirPod stickers and stuck them on the ground, all over the city &#x1f921; pic.twitter.com/hIrZD0wfom&mdash; Pablo Rochat (@PabloRochat) November 17, 2019


“It’s a valuable enough object to make people want to pick it up off the ground,” Rochat said to Vice. 

According to Rochat, he’s placed around 15 stickers so far. No prank is quite worth it without sticking around to see the reactions, however, so Rochat often lingers awhile to watch people bend down to pick up -- or attempt to pick up -- the AirPods. 

To partake in the prank yourself, you can download the AirPod sticker from his website. [mn-post-ender]
