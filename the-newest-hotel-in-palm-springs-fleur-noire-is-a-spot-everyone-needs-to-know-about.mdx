Opened last week, the Fleur Noire Hotel in Palm Springs, California has 21 uniquely designed casitas and studios surrounding a charming courtyard and pool. The walls inside and out are covered in a larger-than-life flower design creating a flower garden feel. The outdoor murals were hand-painted by artist Ouize, and Ellie Cashman designed the interior floral wallpaper.

Built in the 1940s as Burket's Trade Winds Hotel, the historic property has been transformed into a modern mix of casitas, studios, and standard rooms. Each casita retains elements of the original design in addition to updated dining areas in most suites. We stayed in a suite complete with a living room, kitchen/dining area, and large bedroom. The room was spacious and comfy with a modern and airy feel.

Nothing is more important to a Palm Springs hotel than the pool. The Fleur Noir original swimming pool remains the centerpiece of the property. Multiple seating and lounge areas, games, and fire pits for cold nights are set throughout the property. If you book your stay after January 1, 2022, you can enjoy the speakeasy champagne and rosé bar named La Boisson, which will offer dozens of varieties of rosés as well as curated selections of wines, beers, and liquor. If you check-in before that date, bring your own bottles and store them in the fridge that is found in every room.

The starting rate for studio rooms is $185. Reservations can be made at fleurnoirhotel.com, and you can check out more beautiful pics of the property on Instagram at @fleur_noire_hotel.

The hotel is located on the north end of Palm Canyon Drive in a neighborhood that has been revitalized with new hotels, shops, and restaurants in recent years. While you are in the neighborhood you should:

Try the innovative cuisine and cocktails at Sandfish Whiskey &amp; Sushi, which was designed by Fleur Noire Hôtel designer Chris Pardo. Get the Hamachi Kama:  yellowtail collar served with ponzu, scallions &amp; microgreens, and the signature old fashioned.

Walk down North Canyon Drive to Workshop Kitchen + Bar for modern California cuisine, a space recognized by the James Beard Foundation for "Outstanding Restaurant Design."

Start your day at Wilma and Frieda's, the most popular breakfast in town. Get there early and be ready for a line. The blackberry custard french toast is a standout. [mn-post-ender]
