Some pop-up experiences are a bit bizarre but have a certain novel charm. In this particular pop-up, you have to try really, really hard to look past the bizarre and find the charm. The San Francisco Dungeon in Fisherman’s Wharf is hosting a three-day pop-up, from June 13 to June 15, called the Rat Bar. And yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like. Customers will be able to pay $50 for a cocktail, a 60-minute interactive tour of the San Francisco Dungeon, and playtime with a bunch of pet rats from Ratical Rodent Rescue.

According to the press release, the tour will bring you through “different points in time with actors recreating San Francisco’s darkest moments including the gold rush, Chinatown gangs, Miss Piggott’s saloon...the plague (Yassss! More rats!) and conclude in an Alcatraz prison cell where super-creepy ghosts f*#&amp; with you.”

After the tour, you’ll get to spend some quality time with rats. You’ll have 30 minutes with the rats before heading up to the cash bar, where you can enjoy a much-needed drink. Believe it or not, demand for the pop-up is high, and you’ll have to make an advance reservation if you don’t want to miss out. Visit the website to book a reservation. [mn-post-ender]
