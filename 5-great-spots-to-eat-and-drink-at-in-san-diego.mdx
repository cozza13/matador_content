Great patio (image that!) and more mature atmosphere than the rest of PB. Great for happy hours or dinner (I fell in love with the Galician octopus). #eat #dinner #outdoor #patio

The morning after a night of partying at PB's famous bars, head to The Mad Beet for your antioxidant fix. Our favorite is the Beyoncai bowl, which has acai, bananas, peanut butter, strawberries, honey and granola.
