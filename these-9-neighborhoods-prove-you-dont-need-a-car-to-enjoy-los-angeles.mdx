Santa Monica is one of the most walkable neighborhoods in LA. This seaside city features a nice mix of historic and storied establishments like the iconic but ostensibly haunted hotel, The Georgian, alongside a collection of newer, trendy destinations, all made for exploring on foot. It’s the last stop on the Metro J (Silver) line, which means travelers and locals can take the train into town all the way to and from downtown and step off here, never having to worry about driving or parking.

Close to the Metro stop, the Santa Monica Pier and Pacific Park are classic spots for anyone seeking some vintage fun in the form of amusement park rides and arcade games. Explore the dozens of gorgeous murals, or stroll along the 3rd Street Promenade, which comprises three open-air, car-free blocks anchored by the outdoor shopping destination, Santa Monica Place.

Dine at Vamos. Vamos., a margarita and nacho bar recently opened on Main Street. Stay at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel &amp; Bungalows which is just a short 2-block stroll away from the Santa Monica Farmers Market and adjacent to the iconic bar, The Bungalow, which is one of the most legendary spots to experience LA nightlife on the West Side.

Venice Beach dates all the way back to the early 1900s, originally developed and designed by the eccentric millionaire Abbot Kinney as a Los Angeles beach destination resort, paying homage to its Italian theme with canals and pedestrian footbridges to explore. These canals still exist today, as well as the boardwalk — which is an internationally renowned attraction, offering those who are feeling beachy and bohemian dozens of craft booths to explore and nearly endless entertainment from enthusiastic street performers.

Right on the boardwalk adjacent to the iconic “Venice'' sign and the Samesun Venice hostel is Winston House, a restaurant, bar, and live music venue that is a local standby for dining and dancing. Nearby, The Waterfront is a fantastic place to lounge for a boozy brunch and cuisine that’s made from ingredients sourced from local farms. Lastly, Abbot Kinney Boulevard is a mile-long strip with some of the trendiest fashion outlets, beautiful street art, and impressive food venues, just a few minutes' walk from the beach.

Hollywood has long been known as the entertainment capital of the world, serving as home to well-known landmarks including like the Walk of Fame and The Dolby Theatre — and you can still feel the “Old, Golden Age of Hollywood” in an area known as the Vinyl District. The name acts as a tribute to the district’s long history in the music industry with a dozen recording studios, record shops, entertainment labels and more making this district their home. Recently, The Vinyl District has experienced major development, adding new dining concepts and luxurious, boutique hotels.

Vibrant and fabulous West Hollywood technically encompasses less than two square miles of geography between nearby upscale neighborhoods Beverly Hills and the Hollywood Hills — but its wide sidewalks and hundreds of businesses accessible on foot make it one of the most walkable places to be in Los Angeles (plus, there’s even a city-supported free shuttle service). There are three distinct neighborhoods that make up WeHo — The Sunset Strip, The Design District, and Santa Monica Boulevard — each of which features its own personality.

The Sunset Strip has stood as a legend in pop culture for decades as being a rowdy playground for Hollywood’s elite and has seen significant revitalization these past few years, including the introduction of new luxury hotels including The Pendry and its rooftop restaurant, Merois. On Santa Monica Boulevard, which is affectionately referred to as “the rainbow district,” step into the newest installation of Bottega Louie, which has won restaurant design awards for its beautiful interior and exterior style, and impeccable pastries. In the Design District, which covers the Southwestern portion of the area skirting Melrose Avenue, Craig’s is a known celeb hangout hotspot. If you choose the stay in West Hollywood, consider La Peer Hotel, with its restaurant hotspot Issima.

The mid-city neighborhood consists of the walkable Fairfax, Beverly Grove, and West 3rd Street districts. The future purple (D) line Metro extension is scheduled to be completed in the next few years, adding to future accessibility. Once in the area, stop at the Original Farmers Market which has stood for nearly 100 years serving fresh produce and local cuisine at dozens of farmstand booths.

Adjacent to this historic market is the outdoor, upscale mall, The Grove, which feels like a trip abroad and offers some of the best shopping opportunities in the neighborhood. Short Stories Hotel on Fairfax across the street is a great spot for drinks and small plates fireside, and an even better place to crash.
