The world’s top 10 busiest airports by number of travelers


Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport: 75,704,760
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport: 62,465,756
Denver International Airport: 58,828,552
O'Hare International Airport in Chicago: 54,020,399
Los Angeles International Airport: 48,007,284
Charlotte Douglas International Airport: 43,302,230
Orlando International Airport: 40,351,068
Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport: 40,259,401
Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport: 40,117,496
Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas: 39,754,366


This is the first time Orlando has made the list since travel numbers started to be documented in 1991, according to TravelPulse. Dallas/Ft. Worth also saw a big move going up from the 10 spot in 2019. And though travel has been coming back in fits and starts, overall airport traffic is down by 18 percent compared to 2019.

While it’s a sign that people are more than ready to start traveling in the US again, it’s also led to lots of flight cancellations and frequently delayed airlines as the industry works to get back up to speed. Major US airlines are cutting planned summer flights by as much as 10 percent. Prices increased about 40 percent from January to March, and are expected to only get higher.

It’s not just the airlines, of course. Airport staff have felt the tourist crunch as well with some of the longest security line wait times found at busy hubs like Miami (about 47 minutes average time to get through security) and O’Hare (about 40 minutes on average).

This has led some changes to how people book travel. The optimum window for the cheapest flights, for example, has shifted to 21 to 127 days in advance.
