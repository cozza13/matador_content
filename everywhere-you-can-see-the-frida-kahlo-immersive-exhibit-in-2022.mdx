Immersive art exhibits are all the rage these days. There are immersive Van Gogh exhibits in over 40 cities in the United States, and other famous artists are getting their own digital shows every few months. Among them is Mexican artist Friday Kahlo.

Frida Kahlo is one of the most celebrated female painters in history and the best place to see her work (in physical form, not digital) is at the Frida Kahlo Museum in Mexico, otherwise known as La Casa Azul, or “The Blue House.”

The trend of immersive Frida Kahlo exhibits, where her paintings are projected on a venue’s walls, ceilings, and floors for visitors to be totally immersed in the work, started in Mexico City last summer, but it has since spread across the border to the US. Here are all the cities in the US where you can catch a Friday Kahlo exhibit and take in the works of the iconic painter like never before.
