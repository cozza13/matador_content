Some of best new parks from the state that gave birth to modern skateboarding.
California has an amazing range of skateparks. If you’re a skater and you’re travelling about, missing out on California would be like missing out on air and food.

Listed below you’ll find what are arguably the best parks the Golden State has to offer. There’s no specific order here – they’re all good - and they’re all free unless otherwise noted.
Santa Ana Skatepark
Street skaters take note. This 12,000 sq. footer has what you crave: fun boxes, ledges, pyramids, plus 11 and 7 stairs with rails and hubbas.

Benicia X Park
At a cost of $850,000 to build, the 20,000 sq. ft. Benicia park is sick. The street section has all the usual fare and flows into a quarter pipe area that waterfalls into a 9-foot bowl.

Palm Desert Skatepark
If you can stand the heat, you’ll enjoy this park, which is split into 5,000 sq. ft. for beginners and 15,000 sq. ft. for everyone else. A nice snake run spits you out into a 7- foot bowl, plus all the basic street stuff. $5 entry fee.
Martinez Skatepark
If you’re a street skater, this may not be ideal with its limited street course, but the walls and bowl are all 7 feet and offer some nice clean speed.

Get your speed on at Grass Valley with its smooth as silk concrete. Not a ton of stuff for the street skater, but why not try the bowls?

Novato Skatepark
Novato’s 15,000 sq. ft. park has some nice coping and is just as smooth and fast as can be. There’s an open lawn area, and hey, Novato just seems nice and laid back.

Phil Shao Memorial Skatepark, Redwood City
In 1998, pro-skater Phil Shao was killed by a drunk driver. His memory lives on in this 13,000 sq. ft. park. Nice street section, a big bowl and the concrete is swell.
Sunnyvale Skatepark
There’s a nice big bowl, a whole whack of things to grind and some really smooth transitions between the bowls. Throw in the vert wall, stairs, and you’ve got a perfectly skateable 18,500 sq. ft.

Alameda Skatepark
Local skaters built this 15,000 sq. ft. park back in the day. It still holds up today with a good street section and a nice view of the San Francisco bay.
