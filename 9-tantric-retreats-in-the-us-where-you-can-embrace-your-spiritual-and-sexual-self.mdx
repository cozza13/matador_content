Depending on your age, you probably first heard about this subject via Sting, or Finch from American Pie 2 -- and due to these somewhat questionable sources, are none the wiser as to what tantric sex actually is. Are we talking spiritual? Sexual? Will you have a 14-hour orgasm just by looking at someone? Allow us to explain and, perhaps, introduce you to a tantric retreat. 
 
The word "tantra" refers to a type of instructional text that is usually written as a conversation between a god and a goddess. Many of these texts, which were written around 1,500 years ago, included socially transgressive rituals that promoted engagement with the taboo, including sex rites, destruction, intoxicating substances, and...human remains. The goal? Shift people’s thoughts from pure/impure to everything is sacred and intertwined. 
 
Today, when we talk about tantra in the West, we’re usually talking about neo-tantra, which often uses sexuality as a route to self-exploration. Followers talk of a greater connection with their partner, emotional healing, longer-lasting orgasms, and relaxation. It’s based on more modern philosophical practices rather than the traditional tantric scriptures (the human remains bit didn’t make the cut, soz), and sexuality features more prominently. 
 
To help you navigate these complex waters, we’ve rounded up nine of the best tantric retreats in North America. Sadly none of these are Sting-endorsed (we did look), but who wants to pay megabucks for some celebrity-backed getaway anyway. These nine are the real deal and run by highly rated experts. Some are sex retreats, some are not.

Set high above the crashing waves of Big Sur, the Esalen Institute makes a seriously scenic spot to get in touch with your spiritual side. This favorite of the yogic crowd has been the go-to for new-age healing in California for over 60 years -- so rest assured they know their stuff. As well as a full program of yoga, meditation, and tantric classes on offer, there’s also dance, lectures, and massage -- plus the opportunity to grow your own organic food (and tuck into said homegrown goodies in-between classes). 

Education underpins everything this organization does: from one-off lessons to scholarships and MBAs -- there’s something on offer for all levels of commitments. The institute currently runs a tantric retreat (which they stress do not cover tantric sex), as well as a range of other courses and workshops. Check their calander for details.

Intimacy Retreats, various locations, US and worldwide

Certified sex and intimacy pros Richard and Diana Daffner are on-hand to guide you through tantra tai chi -- a practice pioneered by the couple and taught at all their retreats, both in-person and online. Spirituality plays a core focus here, with students being taught to connect the body with the mind to better live in the moment. Once you’re in this space, they’ll show you how to channel this energy into forging a deeper connection with your partner. There’s no nudity in the classes (or any of these on the list for that matter), but you’ll work on tightening the sexual muscles (called pubococcygeal, or PC) to focus your attention on this core part of your body. 

You’ll need to source your own accommodation and food if you head off their in-person tantric retreat -- but the good news is that keeps the cost down. For ultra-low-budget mode, sign up for one of their video programs and save on travel.

Laura's courses merge tantra with traditional yoga and breathwork to help guests get back in touch with their sexual selves. She believes sexual energy is the core of our being -- and when it’s blocked, we’re not reaching our full potential.

All meals are included, and are homecooked and sattvic (that’s made using seasonal ingredients). Laura’s retreats come highly rated -- five-star across the board, so book fast to secure a spot.

As one of the world’s leading sexperts with thousands of hours teaching, training and talking about intimacy to her name, Jacqueline Hellyer is a safe pair of hands.

That doesn’t mean Americans need to miss out, though -- her Men’s Sexual Mastery and Women’s Sexual Empowerment courses are all available online. 

Combining tantric and taoist wisdom with a dash of science, her online sex courses are designed to push attendees up and away from society’s limited societal understanding of what sex is and should be.
