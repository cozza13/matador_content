Light pollution is a hot topic. Many organizations around the world are working to protect our nighttime environment from the damage of artificial lights. In alliance with the International Dark-Sky Association crowdfunded project, SKYGLOW, is exploring North Americaâ€™s dark skies, and the footage is out of this world. 

SKYGLOW is raising awareness of the phenomena known as "skyglow," caused by the increasing spread of electrical outdoor lighting. The excessive use of electrisity does more than restrict our enjoyment of stargazing and night-sky phenomena. It can also have harmful consequences on our fragile environment and be particularly damaging to wildlife. 

The project is currently documenting the effects light pollution is having in North America. By contrasting footage in urban areas with that in dark-sky environments, such as Joshua Tree National Park, SKYGLOW shows us why we need to make changes now to protect this ecosystem for future generations. 

SKYGLOW was created by cinematographer Harun Mehmedinovic, and filmmaker and screenwriter Gavin Heffernan.

Joshua Tree is one of the best places in the US for star gazing. Officially recognized as an International Dark Sky Park, Joshua Tree is known for having little to no light pollution due to its elevation in the High Desert and distance from major cities.

There are some fantastic night-sky tours in Joshua Tree, but you can also enjoy the stars by simply staying overnight in the park. There are plenty of beautiful Airbnbs, many of which have outdoor space where you can hunker down and stargaze. 

If you are passionate about protecting our dark skies, there are quite a few things you can do to help. You can also donate to SKYGLOW or learn more about the importance of this project at one of their events. [mn-post-ender]
