With its Mediterranean-tile roofs and a shoreline that literally glitters under the sun, vacationing in Santa Barbara, California, feels miles away from the Golden State. Think French or Italian Mediterranean. This is why the region is fondly -- and accurately -- referred to as the American Riviera. A quick walk downtown from the beach yields many options for global, eclectic dining and if you play your cards right, by staying in or near downtown Santa Barbara, you likely won’t need to rent a car. Funk Zone is an offshoot of the surrounding wine region but easy to access on foot as it's downtown, home to winery tasting rooms with fun events and food menus. Here are 10 of the best Santa Barbara boutique hotels far from cookie-cutter and heavy on style and intimacy.

Kimpton Canary Hotel

[gallery ids="732358,732357,732356" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Although part of the Kimpton Hotels & Resorts brand, the Canary Hotel carries a unique identity. Spanish-style architecture, including ornate tile work in the guestrooms’ baths and some exterior spaces, is in abundance. Like its sibling hotels, pets stay free. Each room flaunts a four-poster iron-work bed frame draped with Italian Frette linens. Also on the property is a rooftop pool (the only downtown Santa Barbara hotel to have one), with an accompanying lounge; and Finch & Fork, serving farm-to-table meals. Borrow a loaner bicycle to access the neighborhood -- and arrive back by the nightly hosted wine hour.

Hotel Californian

[gallery ids="732349,732348,732347" size="full" type="slider"  /]

On State Street and near the Funk Zone, the 121-room luxury hotel is blessed with interior design by celebrity designer Martyn Lawrence Bullard. The Spanish Colonial-Revival-style architecture and Moroccan-inspired interiors are both romantic and dramatic. While initially opened in 1925, fits and starts mean it’s not been continuously operating but the style definitely feels vintage-y. Since its 2017 opening, this has been a coveted booking for luxury travelers. Blackbird is the hotel’s dinner-only eatery with ocean views and plays a strong mixology game, too, with signature cocktails (like “Anyone for Tennis?”) and dishes such as local yellowtail crudo or local halibut.
