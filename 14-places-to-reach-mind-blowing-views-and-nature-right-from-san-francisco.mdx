Just north of the Golden Gate Bridge is a short and flat 1.7 mile trail to Tennessee Valley Beach. Great for families. For a more rigorous trail you can venture off one of the other trails that lead up in the hills. #hiking #beach #marin #california

    San Francisco, United States
    Located in Golden Gate Park, the Botanical Gardens are a great place to escape the city for a bit and stroll through continent themed gardens. See proteas from South Africa or visit the Asian cloud forest. The best time to visit is probably January when the gardens many magnolia trees are in bloom.
