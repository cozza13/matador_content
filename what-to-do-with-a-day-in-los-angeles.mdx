&nbsp;FarmshopLos Angeles, United StatesTheir breakfast, weekend brunch and dinner are amazing. Hands down the best eggs anywhere, and ask for a side of the house made hot sauce.
You'll find market fresh produce, amazing french toast, and my favorite Iced Americano.

This place is a mecca of locally sourced goods!
