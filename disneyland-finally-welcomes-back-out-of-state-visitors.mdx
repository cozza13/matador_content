If you’ve been itching to visit Mickey Mouse, there’s not much longer to wait. Disneyland in Anaheim, California, will welcome back out-of-state visitors as soon as June 15, 2021.

Disneyland reopened its gates to California residents on April 30, 2021, but the rest of the country can now start planning a trip to the popular park.

Disneyland will continue to enforce mask-wearing indoors and social distancing to keep everyone safe. Guests will not have access to those skip-the-line programs like Masspass and Extra Magic Hours, and some attractions and shows will remain closed. 

If you are looking to plan a trip to Disneyland, you’ll need to make a reservation for the day and park you want to visit. Reservations for out-of-state visitors opened on May 26, The Points Guy reported.

Disneyland recommends that visitors have been fully vaccinated or have had a negative COVD-19 test before visiting. Neither is mandatory to get into the parks. [mn-post-ender]
