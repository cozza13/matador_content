Though the third season of the smash-hit comedy The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, which follows the adventures of Midge Maisel, an obedient housewife turned rule-breaking comedian in New York City, isn’t slated to return until winter, Los Angeles wants to celebrate the return early. On August 15, restaurants around the city will celebrate Maisel Day by time traveling back to 1959 -- at least when it comes to the prices on their menus.

Drive-ins, delis, and ice cream shops -- all the quaint places one might picture a guy in a letterman jacket splitting a malt with a girl in a poodle skirt -- will be partaking in the discounts. Canter’s Deli will be offering the Maisel pastrami sandwich for just 99 cents. After that, pick up a hot dog topped with mustard and sauerkraut at Pink’s Hot Dogs for 59 cents, and an ice cream cone at McConnell’s Fine Ice Creams for just 25 cents. For the true 1950s experience, or at least the one we know from movies like American Graffiti and Grease, head to Mel’s Drive-In, where you can get a burger and fries for just 50 cents. At these prices, the change in your couch cushions could pay for a decadent, five-course meal.

Hotels are offering steep discounts, too. At the The Hollywood Roosevelt, you can book a room for $40 (although you’ll need to stop by on August 14 to make a reservation). Of course, this nostalgia steeped holiday would not be complete without a Mrs. Maisel-inspired makeover. At Drybar, get a $2 blowout and manicure, then slip into your best pencil skirt or three-piece suit and head to Melrose Improv, where the price of admission is only $1.

The full list of establishments participating in Maisel Day can be found on the official website. There’s also a map (hot pink and pastel yellow, naturally) featuring every single location, so be sure to use it to take a day-long Mrs. Maisel-approved tour of the city. [mn-post-ender]
