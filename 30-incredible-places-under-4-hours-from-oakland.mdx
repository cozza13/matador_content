THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON IN OAKLAND that using it as a mere stopover en route to somewhere else doesn't make much sense. But you can't look at a map without noticing the city's proximity to a whole host of pretty amazing places. Here are some ideas for which way to point yourself when you're finally ready to leave town, or just looking for an epic daytrip.



1. Yosemite National Park – Yosemite Village

Travel time: 3 hours, 39 minutes
Follow 1-580 E till 1-205 E. Take CA-120 E, continuing onto Evergreen Rd in Tuolumne County.

Bathed in a blanket of snow or dotted with pastel wildflowers, Yosemite Valley is a sight in any season. Wind through the valley and take in the sweeping vistas and wildlife from afar, or participate in outdoor activities such as hiking and fishing.

2. Golden Gate Fields – Berkeley

Travel time: 11 minutes
Take 1-80 to Gilman St in Berkeley. Take the Gilman St exit from 1-80 E until Eastshore Hwy. Turn onto Gilman St.

Situated on the edge of the bay, Berkeley’s famed racing track is the perfect way to spend a warm afternoon. Come on a Sunday, when everything costs a dollar -- yes, even the beer. 

3. Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve – Antioch

Travel time: 45 minutes
From 1-880 N, take CA-24 E, 1-680 N, and CA-4 E to Auto Center Dr/Somersville Rd in Antioch. Exit CA-4 E at Somersville Rd.

4. Lake Tahoe – Tahoe City

Travel time: 3 hours, 6 minutes
Take 1-80 E to US-50 E. Continue onto CA-89 S.

To everyone that has ever asked a Californian if they've ever seen snow, here’s your answer. The popular winter destination holds its own in summer, too, when Tahoe’s forest-enclosed, emerald freshwater lake mirrors the sky overhead. 

5. Chabot Space & Science Center – Oakland

Travel time: 17 minutes
Take CA-13 N to the Joaquin Miller Road Exit. Turn right at Joaquin Miller Road and follow signs for Chabot Space & Science Center.

6. Muir Woods – Mill Valley

Travel time: 43 minutes
Follow 1-580 W to US-101 S in Marin County. Take the E Blithedale Ave exit.

7. Rafting the American River – Sierra Nevadas

Travel time: 2 hours
Take I-580 E, I-680 N, I-80 E, and US-50 E to the Placerville area.

The South Fork of the American is one of the most popular rafting and kayaking runs in the western US. With both rigorous rapids and calmer spots, this stretch of the American provides a unique perspective on the Californian landscape. It’s also steeped in history -- the gold found in the South Fork’s stream inspired California’s 1849 Gold Rush.

8. Claremont Hotel Club & Spa – Oakland

Travel time: 5 minutes
Exit at Claremont Avenue off of CA-24 E.

10. Mavericks – Half Moon Bay

Travel time: 51 minutes
Take CA-92 W to CA-1 N in Half Moon Bay. Continue on CA-1 N to your destination in El Granada.
