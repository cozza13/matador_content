    Usual breakfast and recipes research for a project. Learned from @rapo4 today to use leftover fried egg oil to fry the bread and it was perfectly crisped. A photo posted by BONNIE TSANG (@bonnietsang) on Oct 19, 2015 at 10:35am PDT


Interior design meets food meets killer photography skills. Think funky wall art inside trendy dream office.

Not only are they praised for being one of the best new restaurants in America, but they always get the nod for food design too.

    Mal from Australia sent us this photo of his 3 Almond Mals (which is Australia-speak for classic longboards, based on what I can glean from @patchettt @simonperini @keironjlewis etc...) Not certain what they call classic cars, but it&#39;s a beautiful photo, nonetheless. #almondsurfboards #classicmal #almondaustralia A photo posted by Almond Surfboards (@almondsurfboards) on Oct 9, 2015 at 11:08am PDT


Old-school longboards are everywhere in LA, but only here are they styled with inspired design.

    There&#39;s so much power in a place like this. In waterways, in alleyways, in roundabouts, and steeples. In whistling, and violins, and clanking coins in train cars. In the way the daylight hits buildings, and hits cobblestones, and coffee cups in afternoon. And there&#39;s power, too, in the way it feels -- whether you&#39;re a visitor or local: as though you&#39;ve been always been here, under tolling bells, in twilight.
