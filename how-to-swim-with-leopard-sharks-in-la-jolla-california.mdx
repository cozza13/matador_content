The best time of year to swim with leopard sharks in La Jolla, California
While it’s possible to spot leopard sharks in La Jolla all year around, the best time of year to swim with leopard sharks in La Jolla is from June through October, when sharks seek shallow waters during mating season. Peak months are August and September, and around then the water temperature will be comfortable for humans, too.

A wetsuit can help keep you warm and protect you from any potential cuts or scrapes while snorkeling or diving. Make sure your wetsuit fits snugly so it doesn’t interfere with your movement or visibility under the water. It’s also a good idea to wear protective shoes like aqua socks or neoprene booties so you don’t injure yourself on any sharp rocks or coral reefs while swimming near shore.
Where can you find leopard sharks
During the summer months, leopard sharks tend to congregate near La Jolla Shores beach, making them easier to spot. Beach goers can also take part in surfing, paddle boarding, snorkeling, and kayaking at this beach. The sharks gather in shallow waters at low tide, especially when the water is less crowded, which is the best place to swim with leopard sharks.

Tour companies, like La Jolla Kayak, offer guided tours to areas of the beach where leopard sharks congregate. Even kids as young as six (as long as they can swim are welcome on these excursions. Even though leopard sharks are not known to attack humans, tour guides can also recommend safety tips for interacting with them – which includes respectfully observing them from a distance.

If you’re an experienced swimmer (and brave) who admires the beauty and grace of sharks, a trip to San Diego in the summer or early fall is not complete without a swim with leopard sharks. If you’re looking for a safe adventure that can include the whole family in one of the most stunning locations in the world, you found it. [mn-post-ender]
