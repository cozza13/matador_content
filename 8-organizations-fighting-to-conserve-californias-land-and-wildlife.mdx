The Save the Redwoods League works in conjunction with state and national parks to save the primeval redwood forests of California. Around since the beginning of the 20th century, the Save the Redwoods league has established redwood preserves and groves, supported reforestation and conservation of forest areas, and purchased redwood groves from private owners. Current projects include preserving 77 acres of land at the Elk River headwaters, a rare pygmy redwood forest, and the North Coast initiative, an interagency collaborative project that protects and restores thousands of acres of old-growth redwoods. Save the Redwoods encourages volunteering, donations, and seedling planting as ways to support their organization.

Their protection covers more than 75 natural preserves all over California, and they also have a branch in Washington.
