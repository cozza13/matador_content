It’s hard to spot the Nobu Ryokan from the busy stretch of Pacific Coast Highway that it sits on. The hotel is unassuming from the outside, but when you step foot in the Japanese Garden, the hustle and bustle from outside disappear. It’s one of the most exclusive properties in Southern California and one of the only truly beachfront properties in LA County, a city known for its amazing beaches. The price tag is steep with rates starting at $2,000. The rooms are perfectly simple in an ultra-luxurious sort of way. The bathrooms are outfitted with traditional Japanese wood soaking tubs, the sitting areas are positioned for ocean views, and the service is impeccable.

Using the Nobu as your hub, this is the perfect way to spend an over-the-top weekend in Malibu, even if you aren't there to surf.

Friday
Check into the Nobu and don’t leave. Watch the sunset from your terrace, light a fire and enjoy some wine. The hotel can deliver from the famous Nobu Restaurant which is just a few doors down. The Miso Black Cod is amazing, it is a classic and it is absolutely worth it. Tuck into your bed and fall asleep to the sound of the Pacific.

Saturday
If you are the type of person who wakes with the sun with plans to exercise, leave the hotel beachside and walk to the Malibu Pier. At the end of it, you will find Malibu Farm Cafe. Order your breakfast and head to the roof to enjoy it perched above the blue waters. If you are more of a rise at noon person, the hotel will order Malibu Farm for you and have it delivered to your suite. The Swedish pancakes are delicious.

After breakfast head to the Cure Spa for a massage or treatment of your choice. Feeling relaxed and happy it’s onto the Malibu Country Mart which is full of local shops and eateries. After the shopping is done follow the line to Broad Street Oyster Co. and get the local live sea urchin. Or, if you are a less adventurous eater, the pasta with Sea Urchin Butter. If seafood is your thing, you can even learn to forage your own.

Make it back to the hotel for sunset and take advantage of the included mini-bar while you watch the day fade away from your terrace.

You now have a decision to make, back out for dinner? Or more cuddle time and take out by the fireplace? If you do venture back out, Geoffrey’s Malibu is a classic, offering California cuisine high on the hillside.

Sunday
Sleep in as long as you can. Take a stroll on the beach, order a lite breakfast from the hotel. Check out at the last possible moment to savor the quiet and calm that the Nobu is known for.

Head to Lily's Malibu for breakfast burritos. The line is long, but worth it. Pro-tip, order ahead so that they are ready on arrival.

Your last stop in Malibu is El Matador Beach, one of the most Instagram-able beaches in California. From the parking lot climb down to the beach stairs and get your photos of the rock caves, formations, and that famous pacific blue. [mn-post-ender]
