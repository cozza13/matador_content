The tallest waterfall in North America is located right here in Yosemite National Park. Yosemite Falls is an impressive 2,425 feet high, making it a popular attraction for visitors.

This picturesque spot has been photographed thousands of times over by both professional and amateur photographers alike.

Mirror Lake is one of many beautiful lakes within Yosemite that is fed by Tenaya Creek. This lake has crystal clear water with reflections so sharp that they look like mirrors on a still day – hence its name! It’s also great for swimming if it’s hot outside, as well as canoeing or kayaking if you want to get out on the water without having to go too far from shore. 


One of the most iconic hikes in the world is also located in Yosemite. The Mist Trail to Vernal and Nevada Falls offers breathtaking views, a challenging climb, and an unforgettable experience. The trail takes hikers on a three-mile round trip from Happy Isles to either Vernal Fall or Nevada Fall. A loop trail can be made by taking the John Muir trail back down to Happy Isles, adding an additional three miles to your trip.[mn-post-ender]
