San Francisco’s iconic Golden Gate Bridge is getting a new neighbor and they are inviting you to come check out (and stay in) Golden Gate National Park this summer. The Lodge at the Presidio, opening June 27, gives guests excellent views of the bridge, Alcatraz Island, and the city’s waterfront as well as the chance to spend the night in the famed military barracks at Infantry Row -- renovated, of course, to luxury hotel standards. 

While the Lodge at Presidio as a hotel is new, the building housing it is anything but. The three-story building was built in the late 1800s and originally served as an Army barracks on the famed Infantry Row. This redevelopment is actually the second hotel within the park’s confines, in addition to the nearby Inn at the Presidio which opened its doors in 2012.

The hotel’s interior design is meant to replicate the original barracks' style with contrasting woods and a number of the original walls still in place. On the outside, the building’s original exterior has been entirely preserved, giving the lodge a historical ambiance to complement its gorgeous views of the Bay.

Outside on the expansive grass area, the hotel hosts what it’s dubbed "Presidio Picnics" each Sunday throughout the summer. These events bring in a collection of well-known food trucks and vendors and provide an opportunity to sample the city’s diverse cuisines. Also available are lawn games, outdoor yoga classes, and a number of family-friendly activities. The city plans to connect Infantry Row to the nearby Chrissy Field and the waterfront with a series of walking paths in a project dubbed "Tunnel Tops," scheduled to be completed in 2021.
