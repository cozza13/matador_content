Working from home can be isolating. Especially in busy SoCal and the Bay Area, where it often seems as though the world is moving all around you while you’re glued to your computer screen in that tiny apartment slash home office. We feel you, and we have a suggestion -- book an Airbnb in Big Sur, get away for a few days or a few weeks, and jolt your productivity with frequent breaks to surf uncrowded waves, explore new hiking or biking trails, and switch up your usual lunch routine on the Pacific Coast Highway. You have plenty of spaces to choose from, and these are the best Airbnbs in Big Sur for both productivity and recreation.

Big Sur Dream Home

[caption id="attachment_649033" align="alignnone" width="1280"] Photo: Airbnb[/caption]

Redwood trees serve as the backdrop to your workspace at this full-home rental south of Carmel. A mountain-view hot tub complements the views, while the interior falls somewhere between a treehouse and a luxury mountain cabin. Take lunch out on the deck among the flowers, though the entire home feels outdoors with its perch above the trees and large, unobstructed windows offering views in all directions. The WiFi is fast, and you won’t find a dedicated workspace with a better view.  [mn-post-ender]
