Tiny Houses have become increasingly popular because of their economical use of space, but tiny restaurants are unexplored territory. Until now, that is. Partnering with A&E, the network that broadcasts Tiny House Nation, IHOP is creating a tiny restaurant in Los Angeles this December. For a limited run of just four nights, the mini-IHOP will feature a kitchen, pancake griddle, and dining space -- which doesn’t exactly sound like a ton of room for extra large pancake stacks.

The 170-square-foot space only accommodates six guests, but that just means your meal will be incredibly intimate. The restaurant will have a four-person booth and a two-person pancake bar. 

Brad Haley, IHOP’s chief marketing officer, said in a statement, “Our friends at A&E’s 'Tiny House Nation' outdid themselves on this project, creating the world’s first International Tiny House of Pancakes -- blue roof and all -- so that we can offer an intimate dining experience to a select group of our super fans. Turning a 4,000-plus square foot restaurant into a 170 square foot space certainly poses its own set of challenges, but the team came up with an ingenious design to retain the integrity of a full-sized IHOP while adding new, fun elements for guests to discover in the Tiny IHOP."

To dine at this tiny restaurant, reservations are required. Bookings are available for the 5:00 PM, 7:30 PM, and 10:00 PM time slots on December 12 through December 15. To reserve, you’ll have to be part of IHOP’s MyHOP program, and the registration deadline is October 20. Once you sign up, you’ll receive instructions on how to make reservations on Yelp.
