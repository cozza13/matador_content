In December this ski resort debuted at the foot of the Massif in the charming Charlevoix region – which only means its prized mountains are in full view from the pool, thanks to its all-glass enclosure. Hammocks are poolside as is an art installation of hand-painted canoe paddles. For a steamy plunge, step outside to the elevated hot tub for an even better view.

In the heart of bustling Barcelona, Hotel 1898's pool at the spa is in a location with serious roots. Before it was a spa, the spot served as the Philippines Tobacco Company’s chambers and, before that, a coal bunker. Exposed-brick walls and shimmery green and blue waters (due to soft backlighting) make the spa a hidden historical wonder.

The hotel’s gold-tiled pool -- fittingly called the Gold Energy Pool -- is about as luxe as it gets. And while views of the surrounding Himalayas are stunning, so is the pool area’s architectural design. Dark-wood tones; art on the walls; and a cathedral ceiling crafted from wood planks cultivate a cozy environment.

[gallery ids="684145,684141" size="full" type="slider"  /]

Just like The City That Never Sleeps, this hotel snug in Times Square, the pool on the ground floor, where a lobby normally might be, stays open late (until 9:00 PM). There’s also a pool bar, sauna and gym adjacent. But what sells the space is the colorful backlighting, including pinks and purples, for a jazzy vibe.
