One of TV’s most recognizable landmarks in San Francisco is about to be restricted to tourists -- at least, if you’re on a tour bus. The house facade that became famous on the '90s sitcom Full House, is now off limits to tour buses. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency voted recently to ban commercial vehicles from a section of Broderick Street, where the house is located, following complaints by neighbors. 1709 Broderick Street became widely-known as the residence of TV’s Tanner family, and was often featured in exterior shots throughout each episode. The show wasn’t, however, actually filmed inside the house, but rather on the Warner Brothers Studio Lot in Los Angeles. 

The ban prohibits vehicles with more than nine seats from driving up Broderick Street between Pine and Bush. Tourism to the area has increased dramatically following the release of the spin-off series Fuller House. Disgruntled neighbors estimate that as many as 1,500 people per day show up to ogle and snap pictures of the famous house, causing congestion and blocking driveways.

The house has changed owners a few times, and was most recently purchased by Full House creator Jeff Franklin in 2016 for $4 million. Reports claimed that he planned to remodel the interior to match the Full House set, but it isn’t clear yet if those plans have come to fruition. For his sake, though, it might be better if fans weren’t peering through his windows, trying to catch a glimpse of the Tanner family kitchen. [mn-post-ender]
