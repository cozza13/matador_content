There’s a saying in wine country: “it takes a lot of beer to make a great wine.”

Though Santa Barbara may be known the world over as one of California’s best wine regions, most visitors don’t know that the region holds another great secret: fabulous breweries. And as for the wine country saying? Well, workers at the local wineries drink beer to stay refreshed during the warm California summer. (And water, of course.)

Many of the best Santa Barbara breweries are family-owned, use local ingredients, and have state-of-the-art facilities, putting the same care into each bottle of beer as the area’s famous wineries put into each bottle of red.

The tour of Santa Barbara breweries below makes the perfect plan for one day of fabulous beer tasting -- especially if you take note of the recommended brew you need to try at each location.
Santa Barbara brewery tour map


If you walk between all eight of the Santa Barbara breweries below without making any stops, you could do it in about 36 minutes and would cover roughly 1.8 miles. However, making stops is the whole point of doing this tour, so plan on a whole day if you're visiting every brewery.

You could also break it up if you don't think you're up for eight breweries in one day. Walking between the first three (Night Lizard, Institution, and Third Window) will take about 10 minutes and cover half a mile, while visiting the last five (Topa Topa, Validation, Brass Bear, Figueroa, and the Brewhouse) will take about 15 minutes and cover just under a mile. The numbering below assumes you'll start at Night Lizard and finish at The Brewhouse.

This eco-friendly, family-operated brewery uses its eclectic beers to bring attention to conservation efforts.

The Nasser family focuses on creating quality beers with local ingredients and is constantly experimenting with new flavors to introduce new brews into their rotation. And thanks to rotating partnerships with local restaurants, they have some of the most varied food among Santa Barbara breweries, too.
2. Institution Ale Co.

On State Street, Santa Barbara’s main thoroughfare, Institution Ale Co. is a local, well, an institution. The friendly atmosphere, exquisite craft beers, and highly regarded pizza menu attract locals and visitors alike. Visitors can post up at the bar to try multiple beers or grab a pint and head to the area of old-school arcade games in the back. Heads-up if you come on NFL or MLB game days: this place gets quite busy with California sports team fans.

This classic American bistro and brewery is a local favorite in Santa Barbara, partly thanks to its extreme dog-friendliness – it even has a separate menu for dogs. The owners, Pete and Casey, take pride in crafting The Brewhouse’s beers on site, using two big copper vessels to complete the process. Check out the extensive list of stouts, pale ales, IPAs, and pilsners, though any of the other 20-plus beers are equally good choices.

The Brewhouse is also one of the few Santa Barbara breweries with a full-service restaurant, offering a variety of appetizers and main dishes covering meat, seafood, and pasta dishes, as well as sandwiches and burgers.
