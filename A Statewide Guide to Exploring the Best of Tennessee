MIDDLE TENNESSEE
DOWNTOWN NASHVILLE
NATCHEZ TRACE
TENNESSEE STATE MUSEUM
Homebase: Nashville, aka “Music City.” The state capital played a massive role in the development of country music — storied honky-tonks still line the downtown streets in the shadow of glass skyscrapers and a modern entertainment scene. Beyond the city limits, you’ll find winding cycle routes, hiking retreats, kayaking oases, and more.

Attractions
Lower Broadway – Head to Lower Broadway to find the historic heart of Music City. While the area has shapeshifted over the years, haunts like Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge, Robert’s Western World, and Acme Feed & Seed still serve up a foot-tappin’ good time.

Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum – Trace the history of country music’s biggest stars back to their beginnings at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. This monument to twang runs the gamut from Hank Williams to Ray Charles and sits within arm’s reach of the honky-tonks of Broadway.

The Parthenon – Nashville is also known as the “Athens of the South.” Built for the 1897 Tennessee Centennial Exposition, this life-size replica of the most famous building in Greece — featuring a to-scale statue of Athena — is as close as you can get to the Mediterranean without crossing an ocean.
